Elevated ferritin levels can have many possible causes. Since your iron-related measurements are within normal range, it is unlikely that the cause of the high ferritin is related to iron deficiency or hereditary hemochromatosis.\n\nOther potential causes include chronic inflammatory conditions (such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, or chronic liver disease), alcohol consumption, and, less frequently, certain types of cancer or genetic disorders. Some medications can also cause elevated ferritin levels.\n\nGiven your history of fibromyalgia, it is possible that your high ferritin could be related to chronic inflammation. However, without a thorough evaluation, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.\n\nI would recommend discussing further investigation with your doctor, such as additional blood tests, imaging studies, or even a liver biopsy, to help determine the cause of your elevated ferritin levels. In addition, if you have not already done so, it may be helpful to see a rheumatologist or other specialist to evaluate your fibromyalgia and any potential underlying inflammatory conditions.\n\nFinally, although there is no direct association between high ferritin levels and fibromyalgia, there may be some indirect links since chronic inflammation can cause musculoskeletal pain and discomfort.

{"input":"Hi doctor,I have a question for my mother. My mother is 50 years old. She complains of episodic, sudden loss of weight bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon. This has resulted in two major falls, which resulted in trauma. These are present for past few months and have become more frequent in the last month. She also has pain in her knees bilaterally, which has been attributed to osteoarthritis. She also complains of hip pain associated with swelling and difficulty in standing, lying and changing sides while sleeping. There is episodic stiffness present in the shoulders, which causes some discomfort in raising arms above the shoulder level. She is taking Bisoprolol 5 mg and Amlodipine 5 mg for high BP and it is well-controlled. She has no history of any allergy. She has kidney stones and so occasional pain in the lumbar area. She used to get constipation frequently. She was hospitalized four times for normal vaginal deliveries and once for abortion. She is monogamous with her husband.

The sudden loss of weight-bearing ability on the left Achilles tendon, along with her other symptoms of joint pain and stiffness, could be indicative of an underlying inflammatory condition such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. The family history of hypertension and CAD also suggest the need to monitor for cardiovascular risk factors. \n\nAdditionally, her hip pain and difficulty with changing positions while sleeping could be indicative of a hip problem such as osteonecrosis or osteoarthritis, and may require further imaging studies such as an MRI or X-ray. Her irregular menstrual cycles and history of menorrhagia warrant further gynecological evaluation to rule out any underlying uterine pathology, particularly given the family history of uterine cancer.\n\nHer history of constipation may also require further workup to rule out any underlying gastrointestinal issues such as inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer. It is also important to evaluate her snoring, as it could be a sign of obstructive sleep apnea, which can further exacerbate cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nOverall, given the complexity and multiple symptoms, a comprehensive evaluation by her primary care physician or a rheumatologist would be recommended to appropriately diagnose and manage her symptoms.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, Thanks for your query.

{"input":"Hello doctor,My son has developed anxiety symptoms about four years ago. They came completely out of the blue. He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel.

The blood levels of thyroid hormones are not always accurate in people with anxiety. In such cases, an ultrasound scan of the neck can be done which can help in differentiating between a normal thyroid gland and enlargement of the thyroid gland due to inflammation or goiter. In case of enlargement of the thyroid gland, the treatment is simple. It consists of taking anti-inflammatory medicines like steroids along with thyroxine. This is called as subclinical hyperthyroidism. In case of thyroiditis, the thyroid function tests may come back normal but there might be some changes seen on thyroid ultrasound.

An intraarticular fracture means there is a displaced break within the joint, which can cause problems with the function of the hand if not treated. ORIF stands for open reduction and internal fixation, which is a surgical procedure used to treat fractures by realigning the broken bones and fixing them in place with plates, screws or rods.\n\nIt is common for patients to wait for a call from the fracture clinic after a CT scan or x-ray. In the meantime, it is important to keep the injured hand immobilized to reduce the risk of further displacement or injury. Buddy taping is the most basic immobilization technique and is usually enough to keep the bones in place until you see a specialist.\n\nIf you are in significant pain or if your fingers show signs of swelling or deformity, you should go back to the hospital or call your doctor to discuss whether you need additional immobilization, such as a cast or splints. They will also be able to advise you on pain management and medical treatment for your injury.\n\nIn the meantime, continue to rest your hand, avoid using it for activities that may cause further damage, and follow your doctor's instructions when taking any medication.\n\nI hope this information helps.

I do not think he is paying enough attention. I am in the medical field and although I am not a pharmacist or an M.D. I know a little bit about adverse drug reactions. Tell me if this makes sense to you.Metoprolol tartrate 25 mg half pill twice a day, Potassium Chloride 20 mEq once daily, Losartan potassium 25 mg once daily, Warfarin sodium 5 mg once daily, Atorvastatin 20 mg, Digozin 25 mcg once daily and Furosemide 40 mg once daily.I need to know if these medications are fine to take all in one day and if so, I would like to split them into two times a day according to the reactions. I feel that so many medications doing the same thing is redundant and unnecessary and causing problems. Please help me.\nOutput: Hi. Let us evaluate all medications your father is receiving. Diagnosis: Valvotomy, CAD with MI (coronary artery disease with myocardial infarction) and CVA (cerebrovascular accident) (recovered). Tablet Metoprolol is essential in patients with heart attacks as it slows the heart and keeps it healthy. So we cannot omit that. The dose is already very low and so we cannot reduce it further. Tablet Losartan, again essential in people with heart attacks. It is a disease-modifying  ChatDoctor.  The dose is already less and cannot be reduced. But yes, the timing can be changed to alternate with Metoprolol (one in the morning and one in the evening). The danger is giving Potassium tablet Losartan and Digoxin and can cause increased potassium levels and giving more potassium is highly dangerous. The doctor might have given for some time but it has to be stopped now. Warfarin is given for stroke prevention. 5 mg is a minimal dose. It cannot be removed as stroke prevention is essential. Timing can be made flexible. Atorvastatin is for heart attack prevention. Ideally can be taken at bedtime. Frusemide is a diuretic. There is no specific reason to give this in your case. The only issue I can think of is because of the valve surgeries they want to keep blood volume low. This can be discussed and removed. Ideally can be given in the morning. About Aspirin, it should not be given when you are giving Warfarin. Remove it if it is still on. If the blood becomes very thin then there are chances of brain hemorrhages. I hope this helps. <|endoftext|>"}

I have gone through your lab reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and they are consistent with the diagnosis made by your doctor.Yellowish tint of the eyes is due to increased bilirubin levels. This is due to the increased red blood cell destruction in the spleen and is commonly a complication of hereditary spherocytosis. It is understandable that you are feeling weak since your body is producing red blood cells at an accelerated rate to compensate for the destruction occurring in the spleen. This is also the reason why your spleen is enlarged. If your condition worsens, your doctor might suggest a splenectomy. This will not cure the condition but will relieve the symptoms since the site of destruction of red blood cells will be removed and your red blood cells will be able to survive for a longer period in the blood. Splenectomy, however, can predispose one to certain bacterial infections and it is important that you receive the appropriate vaccines regularly. You could take folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements since one of your blood tests show macrocytic anemia. For more information consult a hematologist online <|endoftext|>"}

A platelet count of 1314 is extremely high (normal range is typically 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter of blood). This condition is known as thrombocytosis, and it can have several potential causes. Some possible explanations for high platelet counts include:\n\n1. Essential thrombocythemia: This is a rare condition in which the bone marrow produces too many platelets. It can cause blood clots and other complications, and may require treatment.\n\n2. Reactive thrombocytosis: This is a response to another underlying condition, such as an infection or inflammation. In this case, treating the underlying condition should resolve the thrombocytosis.\n\n3. Iron-deficiency anemia: Although this might seem counterintuitive, severe iron-deficiency anemia can lead to an increase in platelet count because the body is trying to compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying red blood cells.\n\n4. Certain medications: Some medications, such as steroids and epinephrine, can cause an increase in platelet count.\n\n5. Other conditions: There are several other conditions that can cause high platelet counts, including cancer, liver disease, and some autoimmune disorders.\n\nIf your doctors are unable to give you a specific reason for your high platelet count, I would recommend seeking a referral to a hematologist (blood specialist).

{"input":"Hello doctor,I had a silent missed abortion last year in the third month of my pregnancy. After that, I got some tests done, which resulted in CMV IgG positive. Then I got vaccinated for rubella to prevent any casualties in the next pregnancy. Now I want to try and conceive, but just now I got my torch panel done again. And now the HSV IGM is positive with 1.15 range along with CMV and rubella IgG positive. Should I wait or can I try to conceive right now? My husband\\s torch panel also done, nothing abnormal.I am currently under Folic acid and Multivitamin, for now, to conceive faster. And also a homeopathic medicine for migraine.","answer_icliniq":"Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Yes, you can try for your pregnancy as IgG (immunoglobulin G) means that you do not have any current infection. It is only due to prior exposure. And for HSV, the only thing you have to watch is the presence of active lesions. Otherwise, there is no other reason not to try for pregnancy. You must try for it whenever you and your partner feel ready to do so. Secondly, abortion is a very common thing in reproductive age and only after one abortion there is no need to undergo all these extensive investigations. I hope it has helped you. ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello! I'm sorry to hear about your previous silent missed abortion, and I understand that you are concerned about your Torch panel results.\n\nFirst, let me explain the Torch panel. It is a blood test that checks for several infections that can impact a pregnancy. The test includes four main components: Toxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV).\n\nI can see that your previous test showed that you were positive for CMV IgG. This means that you have been exposed to the virus in the past and that your body has developed antibodies against it. A positive IgG result is generally not a concern in pregnancy.\n\nRegarding Rubella, I'm glad to see that you were vaccinated after your previous abortion. This will help protect you and your future fetus from Rubella.\n\nNow coming to your current HSV IgM result, I must say that it is of concern. IgM antibodies typically indicate a recent HSV infection, and in the context of trying to conceive, this could be risky. HSV infection during pregnancy can cause problems such as neonatal herpes, which can be severe or even deadly in some cases.\n\nHowever, it's important to keep in mind that HSV IgM results can be a false-positive. This means that the test may show an incorrect positive result. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may recommend further testing.\n\nIn the meantime, it's essential to use safe sex practices to reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to your partner. Also, please consult with your healthcare provider about the proper next steps and what this test result could mean for your future pregnancy.\n\nFinally, please continue taking folic acid and a multivitamin to prepare and support a healthy pregnancy. I hope this information helps!","answer_chatdoctor":"1) You should not be worried about this as the test has only been done once and it may have been positive at other times too.2) You need not worry about your husbands test.3) I would suggest that you should continue with the treatment that you are already taking, and if you get pregnant then you should take all the necessary antibiotics and prophylactic medicines.4) I don't think there is anything wrong in trying to conceive at present.","text":"Instruct: Hello doctor,I had a silent missed abortion last year in the third month of my pregnancy.

As there is oligomenorrhoea and your menses have returned after a long time, eight months now, it is essential that the cause needs to be investigated. The likely reasons are PCOS (polycystic ovarian syn ChatDoctor.  You need to get a complete hormonal profile with serum estradiol and serum testosterone levels with ultrasound pelvis to look for ovarian cysts (PCOS). The bleeding post intercourse is likely due to cervical erosions, which can cause bleeding and hence, a per speculum exam with a Pap smear is necessary as well. The ultrasound can deduce the endometrial thickness and if thick then an endometrial biopsy may also be taken for histopathological examination and learning the phase of the endometrium.

Obesity itself is a part of insulin resistance in PCOS, which can cause ovulation and hence delayed menses often. Please review with reports for further discussion and advice. <|endoftext|>"}

It is important to talk to your doctor about any concerns you have regarding your sexual function as there can be several factors that lead to erectile dysfunction such as psychological, hormonal, or vascular issues. Your doctor may recommend further tests or refer you to a specialist if needed. \n\nRegarding your HGH levels, a low level can contribute to decreased growth in height. The follow-up blood test you mention may provide more information about your HGH levels. If your levels are consistently low, your doctor may consider treatment options such as HGH therapy, but this would require a detailed evaluation and discussion.\n\nThere are several ways to increase testosterone levels, such as maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, eating a balanced diet, and reducing stress. However, it is important to note that increasing testosterone levels should only be done under the guidance of a healthcare professional.\n\nRegarding your torsion, it is unlikely to have an impact on your hormones. However, it is important to mention any past medical conditions or surgeries to your doctor so they have a complete picture of your health history.\n\nLastly, carrying your mobile phone in your pocket is not known to affect testosterone levels or growth in height.\n\nI hope this information helps. Please discuss your concerns with your doctor and follow their recommendations.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. Your age is 18 years, and your height is 173 cm.

The result came back a week later and it said that I had a low HGH level and a 21\/42 level testosterone. Is this normal for an 18 year old male? I was devastated that my growth plates were closed, because I also had an x-ray of left hand. My doctor asked me whether I am sexually active. I answered him no.

Chronic hepatitis B infection can lead to liver damage, cirrhosis, liver cancer, and other complications.\n\nBased on your test results, you have evidence of past exposure to HBV, but your current test results are negative for HBsAg, which means that you do not have an active hepatitis B infection. The positive hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) indicates that you have had a previous HBV infection, but it cannot determine whether the infection was acute or chronic.\n\nIf you develop HBsAg positivity in the future, it may indicate the presence of an active HBV infection. However, if you do not develop HBsAg positivity and your hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs) levels become detectable, it may indicate that you have cleared the infection and developed immunity.\n\nIn summary, the majority of people who are infected with HBV are able to clear the virus from their bodies without any long-term consequences.

{"input":"Hello doctor,Just two days ago I found out I was about 1-2 weeks pregnant. And it has been about 4 1\/2 weeks since my last menstrual period. Unfortunately with labor day being this weekend I have been unable to see my regular OBGYN. But I did go to the ER to confirm the pregnancy 2 days ago. So my blood results came back with an HCG OF 248 and the doctor said I am right around 1-2 weeks.So, here is my question. I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain. I have been taking both of the medications during my pregnancy when I had no idea I was pregnant. Since finding out I have tried tapering on both medications. The Percocet is making me sweat and very agitated and when I tried to cut down on the Lorazepam I was shaking and almost hallucinating and delusion. I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating. I want to be off both these medicines but I am worried more about the Lorazepam as it is a class D pregnancy drug. I have read about the terrible problems this causes for infants. I am so scared that I am considering abortion. I do not want to be a terrible mother before I even give birth. I have been having bad panic attacks over this and cannot seem to relax as the complications of these medicines are always on my mind. Any advice at all would be very much appreciated.","answer_icliniq":"Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Well in your case, as you said rightly Lorazepam is category D  ChatDoctor.

However, it is not advisable to abruptly stop taking either of the medications without consulting your doctor. Sudden discontinuation of benzodiazepines can cause withdrawal symptoms and pose a risk to the developing fetus. Similarly, opioid use during pregnancy has been associated with complications such as preterm labor and neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n\nIt is important to work with your healthcare provider to develop a tapering plan that safely and gradually reduces your medication use while also managing your symptoms. Your doctor may consider switching you to a safer medication or non-pharmacological treatments for anxiety and pain management.\n\nAbortion may not be necessary if a cautious approach is taken to manage medication use during pregnancy. It is important to remember that many women have healthy pregnancies while taking medications under the supervision of their healthcare providers.\n\nI would recommend scheduling an appointment with your regular OBGYN as soon as possible to discuss your concerns and develop a safe and effective plan for managing your medications during pregnancy.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine which is a group C teratogen, meaning it can cause harm to the fetus. It should not be taken during pregnancy if possible. However, there are some women who may need it for their health, and they will have to weigh risks vs benefits. If you were taking Lorazepam only, you might consider taking it while pregnant. You could try switching to another anti-anxiety medicine such as clonazepam or alprazolam. These two are considered safe during early pregnancy. In addition, you should continue to take your other medication such as percocet. This can help reduce the symptoms of nausea, headache etc. Hope this helps.

{"input":"Hi doctor,My son hit his mouth on the bathtub while playing when he was 9 months old, causing both top front teeth to be pushed up into his gums. They came back down, and the dentist said they were fine. Now he is 4.5 years old, one of the teeth is ready to fall, and his dentist wants to pull out the other front tooth with a strong root. He says it is best if they both come out at the same time, but did not explain further. Is pulling an absolutely good tooth the best option? I am attaching the x-rays of the teeth.","answer_icliniq":"Hi. I have seen the x-rays that you have attached to the complaint (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Thank you. For more information consult a dentist online ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello,\n\nThank you for reaching out. Based on the x-rays provided, it appears that there is some resorption (shrinking) of the roots of both of the front teeth. This is likely due to the trauma that occurred when your son hit his mouth on the bathtub when he was 9 months old. Ultimately, the decision to extract one or both of the front teeth should be based on a variety of factors, including the extent of root resorption, the health and condition of the surrounding teeth, and your son's overall dental health.\n\nIn some cases, when one tooth has significant root resorption, it may be better to extract that tooth and leave the healthier tooth in place. This is because leaving a tooth with significant root resorption can increase the risk of infection, abscess, and other complications. Pulling both teeth at the same time may be recommended in order to prevent any potential issues with bite alignment or other dental problems that could arise if the teeth are extracted at different times.\n\nHowever, I would recommend discussing your concerns with your son's dentist and asking for more information about the reasons for recommending extraction of the good tooth. It's also a good idea to get a second opinion from another dentist or specialist, especially if you have any doubts or concerns. \n\nI hope this information helps. Best of luck to you and your son.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi Dear, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns. As per your complaint in case of trauma the tooth has to be removed as it is nonvital and there is no chance of saving it. The tooth which has already erupted can be saved by RCT (root canal treatment) or extraction depending upon the status of the tooth. In case of traumatic injury the tooth has to be extracted as there is risk of infection spreading to adjacent teeth. For any more queries you may contact me. Wishing him good health and early recovery.","text":"Instruct: Hi doctor,My son hit his mouth on the bathtub while playing when he was 9 months old, causing both top front teeth to be pushed up into his gums.

I am sorry to hear that you have been experiencing unpleasant symptoms with the medications you have tried for your hypothyroidism. As an AI language model, I cannot provide specific medical advice or treatment plans, but I can provide general information on this topic.\n\nIn general, the goal of thyroid hormone replacement therapy is to achieve normal levels of thyroid hormones in the body. While natural desiccated thyroid hormone medications (such as Armour and Nature-thyroid) contain both T4 and T3 hormones, synthetic thyroid hormone medications (such as levothyroxine and liothyronine) can also be used in combination as well.

For example, some patients may benefit from starting with a low dose of T3 hormone and gradually increasing it to avoid the initial adverse effects that can occur with T3 hormone supplementation. Other patients may be better suited to monotherapy with levothyroxine (synthetic T4 hormone).\n\nI recommend consulting with an endocrinologist or other qualified healthcare provider who can evaluate your complete medical history, perform thorough laboratory tests, and recommend the most appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy for you.

I have seen the attached picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). For more information consult a plastic surgeon online ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello,\n\nI am sorry to hear that your scar revision surgery is not healing well. Based on the picture you have attached, it does seem like the scar is red and raised, which indicates that it is still in the early stages of healing. Involuntary frowning can definitely contribute to the worsening of the scar, as repeated facial movements can cause tension on the incision site and slow down the healing process. Taping your forehead so that you cannot make frown lines may be helpful, as it can decrease tension on the scar.\n\nBotox can also be effective in temporarily stopping frowning and reducing tension on the incision site, but it is important to discuss this with your surgeon before proceeding. Your surgeon can also recommend other scar management techniques, such as massage, pressure garments or laser therapy, that may be beneficial for your specific case.\n\nUsing a vitamin C and silicone scar cream is a good start, but it is important to make sure that you are using it correctly and not over-applying it. Over-applying scar creams can cause more harm than good, as it can increase the risk of infection and interfere with the healing process. You can ask your surgeon or a wound care nurse for advice on how much and how often to apply the scar cream.\n\nIt is normal to feel depressed and frustrated about the scar revision, but it is important to stay positive and patient. Scar healing is a slow process, and it can take weeks or even months for the scar to fully heal and fade. In the meantime, try to avoid harsh sunlight, smoking and environmental pollutants, as they can all have a negative impact on scar healing.\n\nWishing you a speedy recovery.","answer_chatdoctor":"1) The scar is still redder than at first surgery. 2) It looks like a hypertrophied scar with thickness (not just color) 3) Vitamin C and silicon may help but it will take some time for them to work. 4) The creases in your face may cause more stress on the scar, so it may be best to wait until the scar has settled down before trying to do anything else.5) Botox would likely reduce facial movement which could lead to less creasing of the scar.6) You could try tape to prevent wrinkles from forming while healing.7) Taping alone won't fix a hypertrophied scar, but it should help reduce the amount of redness.8) I hope that helps.","text":"Instruct: Hi doctor,My scar revision surgery is not healing well, and it seems worse than last week.

{"input":"Hi doctor,I have a lower wisdom tooth that has been infected chronically for well over a year. I also have an upper molar that is broken decayed and has been like this for years. The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned. She slightly cleaned the gums around the wisdom tooth and prescribed me Cephalexin and sent me on my way. I have been taking Cephalexin for a few days, and yet the tooth is still oozing. My throat is red and irritated, the gums inflamed and there is no swelling in the mouth. Also, my nostril on that side is tender and painful. I am severely worried about the infection spreading to either my heart or my brain. In fact, I read an article a few days ago about a 26 year old who died from a tooth infection spreading.I do not have a fever. I have mild nausea. It is tender on that side of my jaw. The dentist had said the next thing she could give me was Clindamycin, but I have a fear of the side effects of that medicine. I already have heart problems and mild stomach issues. I have read that Clindamycin can cause severe gastrointestinal problems and arrhythmias. She also suggested Zithromax, but I have had heart palpitations while on that medication as well.

It's important to address dental infections promptly to prevent them from spreading to other parts of the body. \n\nIt sounds like you have been prescribed Cephalexin, which is a common antibiotic used to treat dental infections. However, if you have been taking it for a few days and are not seeing improvement, it's possible that the bacteria causing the infection are resistant to Cephalexin. Your dentist or doctor may need to prescribe a different antibiotic, such as Clindamycin or Zithromax, to effectively treat the infection. \n\nI understand your concerns about potential side effects of these antibiotics. While they can have side effects, it's important to balance the risks and benefits of taking them. Untreated dental infections can lead to serious complications, including the spread of infection to other parts of the body. Your healthcare provider will likely consider your medical history and current health status when deciding which antibiotic to prescribe. \n\nIn the meantime, you can try to alleviate your symptoms by gently rinsing your mouth with warm salt water and taking over-the-counter pain relievers (if you are able to take them).

He also gave me Sucralcoat Ano cream. However, every night I was in too much pain. So, early this year, I decided to consult an Ayurveda doctor who gave me some Kashayams and tablets. However, my pain did not subside. I used to evacuate the stools using my fingers. That eliminated the stools, but there was so much mucus released and extreme pain after motion.

For constipation: increase your fiber intake by eating more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. You can also take fiber supplements, such as psyllium husk, to help with regular bowel movements. Stay hydrated and try to exercise regularly, as this can also promote bowel movements. Additionally, laxatives may be prescribed by your doctor if needed.\n\n2. For anal fissure and internal hemorrhoids: try sitz baths, which involve soaking your anal area in warm water for 10-15 minutes several times a day. Avoid straining and pushing during bowel movements. Over-the-counter creams, such as hydrocortisone cream or witch hazel, may also help reduce inflammation and irritation.\n\n3. For SRUS: a high-fiber diet and regular bowel movements can help reduce inflammation and irritation. Your doctor may also suggest topical treatments, such as corticosteroid creams or suppositories.\n\n4.

This month, I had pain in my scrotum in the right spermatic cord region above the testicle. My urologist told me to have sonography. My sonography report concluded \"diffuse thickening at the right spermatic cord region.\" Otherwise, the report is normal.The doctor prescribed me Cefixime 100 mg and an anti-inflammatory tablet for 10 days. My pain decreased about 60%. A week ago, I had masturbation and I had pain at the same place in the scrotum. I had taken a urine culture test and I have attached the report.

You seem to be suffering from an infection in your spermatic cord that is the cause of your scrotal pain. This is treated with antibiotics but the duration of treatment is usually for two weeks or more. The pain you have on masturbation is due to the inflammation of the spermatic cord through which the sperms come out into the urethra. I would suggest you keep your scrotum elevated with a tight underwear for pain relief. It would also be necessary to make sure that the infection has been cleared by testing both urine and semen for infection as your symptoms are not resolved. For more information consult a urologist online ","answer_chatgpt":"Based on your symptoms and medical history, it is possible that you had a urinary tract infection (UTI) or sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the past, which was successfully treated with Norfloxacin. The recent pain in the right spermatic cord region could be related to the same infection or could be due to other causes like epididymitis or varicocele.\n\nYour urine culture report shows significant growth of Escherichia coli, which is a common bacteria that can cause UTIs. This indicates that you currently have a UTI and need appropriate antibiotics for treatment. Cefixime is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that can treat UTIs caused by E. coli, but depending on the sensitivity pattern of the bacteria, you may need a different antibiotic.\n\nIt is important to complete the full course of antibiotics as prescribed by your urologist and also drink plenty of fluids to help flush out the bacteria from your urinary system. Once the infection is treated, the pain in the scrotum should also subside.\n\nTo prevent recurrent UTIs, you should maintain good hygiene, drink plenty of water, urinate frequently, and avoid holding urine for prolonged periods. Also, practice safe sex and use condoms to prevent STIs. If you have any concerns or doubts about your sexual health, you can get tested for STIs at a laboratory or clinic.\n\nIn summary, based on your symptoms and urine culture report, it is essential to complete the course of antibiotics prescribed by your urologist to treat the current UTI.

Take care.","text":"Instruct: Hello doctor,I am a 32-year-old male with a weight of 58 kg and my height is 5 feet 3 inches. I have been married for six years. I have two children. I had yellowish like liquid discharge from my penis a year ago with burning while urinating. I consulted a urologist and he prescribed me Norflox 400 mg for one week and after which it went away. This month, I had pain in my scrotum in the right spermatic cord region above the testicle. My urologist told me to have sonography. My sonography report concluded \"diffuse thickening at the right spermatic cord region.\" Otherwise, the report is normal.The doctor prescribed me Cefixime 100 mg and an anti-inflammatory tablet for 10 days. My pain decreased about 60%. A week ago, I had masturbation and I had pain at the same place in the scrotum. I had taken a urine culture test and I have attached the report. My question is do I have sexually transmitted diseases or urinary tract infection? Can I please know what to do? What medicines should I take for a permanent cure?\nOutput: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your symptoms. You seem to be suffering from an infection in your spermatic cord that is the cause of your scrotal pain. This is treated with antibiotics but the duration of treatment is usually for two weeks or more. The pain you have on masturbation is due to the inflammation of the spermatic cord through which the sperms come out into the urethra. I would suggest you keep your scrotum elevated with a tight underwear for pain relief. It would also be necessary to make sure that the infection has been cleared by testing both urine and semen for infection as your symptoms are not resolved. For more information consult a urologist online <|endoftext|>"}

This can result in pain and discomfort that may continue even when you are not actively exercising or engaged in these activities.\n\n2. Injury or trauma: A traumatic injury to the knee, such as a fall or a direct blow to the knee joint, can cause damage to the tissues and structures in the knee, resulting in ongoing pain and discomfort.\n\n3.

I am not sure if it is food or scar tissue because when I tried to get it out with a toothpick, it did not come out very easily, so I left it alone. Is this food or scar tissue? It is mildly bothersome.I brush my teeth but know to be careful around the surgical sites so they do not get irritated. It seems like a lot of plaque builds up back there because of this, and I am not quite sure what to do. Also, there is a very small spot of red gums on the front side of my second molar. I put a bit of mouthwash on it with a toothpick and left it alone.I have two questions, what is the whitish stuff that feels like food trapped in my healing gum socket? And what is this small patch of irritated gum on my second molar? Any help is appreciated.I am currently on Celexa (for depression), 600 mg of Ibuprofen (for wisdom tooth pain).\nOutput: Hi. As it is just one week of wisdom teeth extraction, the white stuff seems to be most probably healing tissue only. It is a normal appearance of healing tissue post-extraction. A white patch of irritated gum can be due to injury or ulceration that can be due to accidental injury with the extraction instrument or can be due to injury with a toothbrush or any hard food. You can apply Chlorhexidine gel over it. Do warm saline gargles, antiseptic mouthwash gargles and brush your teeth twice a day for keeping plaque and deposits less accumulated. I hope this helps. <|endoftext|>"}

So, we need to ascertain whether the gall bladder stone was responsible for your abdominal pain or not. If it appears that the stone was the cause of your pain, then surgery can be considered.

","answer_chatgpt":"Hello!\n\nGallbladder stones are a common condition that can cause inflammation, pain, and other symptoms. The treatment for gallbladder stones depends on a few factors, including the size and number of stones, and the severity of symptoms.\n\nIn most cases, the recommended treatment is surgery to remove the gallbladder. This is called a cholecystectomy, and it can be done through open surgery or laparoscopic surgery (also known as keyhole surgery).\n\nLaparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive approach that involves making small incisions in the abdomen and using a special tool to remove the gallbladder. This is less invasive than open surgery and typically has a faster recovery time. The cost of laparoscopic surgery can vary depending on the hospital and location, but it can range from $3000 to $10000.\n\nBefore surgery, your doctor may recommend a special diet to help manage symptoms and prevent complications. They may also prescribe medication to help dissolve small gallstones, although this treatment is typically only effective for certain types of stones.\n\nAfter surgery, most people can return to regular activities within a few weeks. Your doctor will provide specific instructions for recovery and follow-up care.\n\nIt is important to discuss all treatment options and cost with your doctor before making a decision.

However, it can cause infections in the urinary tract or bloodstream in certain situations, such as after surgery.

In some cases, a repeat surgery may be necessary to reposition the bladder.

{"input":"Hello doctor,I am a 29-year-old female. I was just diagnosed with chronic urticaria. I went to an allergic specialist for skin testing because my skin was so sensitive I reacted to everything. They then did the RAST test on me. Everything came out class 0 except for egg white, wheat, and oats being class 2 and milk, and hazelnut being class 1. Can these cause anaphylaxis? How accurate are the RAST test? I was put on an elimination diet but the hives are still there. I occasionally get angioedema with it also. Can angiodema cause anaphylaxis? As you can see I am so scared for my throat to close up that I am scared to eat anything. I have only been eating a couple of things daily and live off that.","answer_icliniq":"Hello,  Welcome to ChatDoctor. RAST is a highly accurate test. If the test is positive for a specific allergen, it shows that you are sensitized to that particular allergen. This means that you may mount an allergic response when you are exposed to that allergen. However, it does not mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to that substance and, nor does it mean that any reactions will be severe. If the test is negative, it means that one does not have the ability to mount an allergic reaction to that allergen and any symptoms one may be experiencing are probably not due to an allergic reaction to that substance. However, the results of the RAST need to be interpreted in conjunction with your clinical history. e.g the presence of allergy to some or few allergens which may possibly be present either in the environment or food does not necessarily mean that they are responsible for the symptoms because if they are not even present in the environment or food of an individual, then they are irrelevant. In your case, an elimination diet has not helped thus proving the fact that RAST test results should be carefully interpreted along with clinical history and does not necessarily mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to the substance that you tested. Angioedema is frequently associated with urticaria. Pathogenesis is the same for both urticaria as well as angioedema. The presence of angioedema does not always mean that it is a part of anaphylaxis. Angioedema can be a part of anaphylaxis in those individuals who have a severe allergic reaction to an allergen with high levels of antibodies circulating in the blood. Since you have only class 1 and 2 level antibodies therefore it is unlike that these antigens or allergens would cause anaphylaxis. ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello,\n\nI'm sorry to hear about your condition. Chronic urticaria can be an extremely frustrating and uncomfortable condition to live with. I'll try to answer your questions to the best of my knowledge.\n\nFirstly, the RAST test is generally considered to be a reliable test for detecting IgE-mediated allergies. It measures the amount of IgE antibodies in your blood to specific allergens. However, it isn't 100% accurate and can still give false positive or false negative results. So, it's not uncommon to have positive RAST test results but not have any symptoms upon exposure to the allergens.\n\nRegarding the potential for anaphylaxis, a positive RAST test doesn't necessarily mean that you will experience anaphylaxis upon exposure to a particular allergen. Anaphylaxis is a severe, potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can affect multiple organs in the body, including the airways, cardiovascular system, and skin. Not everyone who has a positive allergy test will experience anaphylaxis. However, it is possible to have an anaphylactic reaction to any allergen, not just the ones you tested positive for.\n\nAngioedema is a condition in which there is a rapid swelling of the deeper layers of the skin and tissue beneath. It can occur in response to an allergic reaction, but it can also be caused by other factors, such as certain medications or underlying medical conditions. While angioedema isn't typically associated with anaphylaxis, it can cause swelling in the throat, which can potentially lead to difficulty breathing.\n\nIt's understandable to be afraid of eating due to the possibility of an allergic reaction. However, it's important to have a well-balanced and varied diet to ensure that your body is getting all the nutrients it needs to function properly. You may want to consider working with a registered dietitian or nutritionist who can help you develop a safe and balanced meal plan that takes your food allergies into account.\n\nI hope this helps. If you have any further concerns, I encourage you to speak with your doctor or allergist.","answer_chatdoctor":"1. The RAST test is very specific and usually accurate. However, the sensitivity of the test depends upon the level of antibody in your blood. So when they say that the level of allergen is less than certain amount, it doesn't mean that you will not be reactive to it. You may be mildly or moderately reactive to it. 2. Angiodema is not a common complication of food allergy and anaphylaxis. It is more likely to occur due to insect stings or some medications like beta-blockers etc.","text":"Instruct: Hello doctor,I am a 29-year-old female. I was just diagnosed with chronic urticaria. I went to an allergic specialist for skin testing because my skin was so sensitive I reacted to everything. They then did the RAST test on me. Everything came out class 0 except for egg white, wheat, and oats being class 2 and milk, and hazelnut being class 1. Can these cause anaphylaxis? How accurate are the RAST test? I was put on an elimination diet but the hives are still there. I occasionally get angioedema with it also. Can angiodema cause anaphylaxis? As you can see I am so scared for my throat to close up that I am scared to eat anything. I have only been eating a couple of things daily and live off that.\nOutput: Hello,  Welcome to ChatDoctor. RAST is a highly accurate test. If the test is positive for a specific allergen, it shows that you are sensitized to that particular allergen. This means that you may mount an allergic response when you are exposed to that allergen. However, it does not mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to that substance and, nor does it mean that any reactions will be severe. If the test is negative, it means that one does not have the ability to mount an allergic reaction to that allergen and any symptoms one may be experiencing are probably not due to an allergic reaction to that substance. However, the results of the RAST need to be interpreted in conjunction with your clinical history. e.g the presence of allergy to some or few allergens which may possibly be present either in the environment or food does not necessarily mean that they are responsible for the symptoms because if they are not even present in the environment or food of an individual, then they are irrelevant. In your case, an elimination diet has not helped thus proving the fact that RAST test results should be carefully interpreted along with clinical history and does not necessarily mean that you will necessarily have an allergic reaction to the substance that you tested. Angioedema is frequently associated with urticaria. Pathogenesis is the same for both urticaria as well as angioedema. The presence of angioedema does not always mean that it is a part of anaphylaxis. Angioedema can be a part of anaphylaxis in those individuals who have a severe allergic reaction to an allergen with high levels of antibodies circulating in the blood. Since you have only class 1 and 2 level antibodies therefore it is unlike that these antigens or allergens would cause anaphylaxis. <|endoftext|>"}

Aim to continue with stretches for as long as possible. ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello! Thank you for your questions!\n\n1. Eating habits and certain foods can impact sleep in various ways. Heavy meals close to bedtime can cause indigestion and discomfort, making it difficult to fall asleep. Foods that are high in sugar, caffeine or spicy foods can also interfere with sleep quality. On the other hand, consuming foods that are high in tryptophan (a natural sleep aid) such as milk, turkey, and nuts, can promote a better night's rest. Additionally, eating foods with high levels of antioxidants, such as fruits and vegetables, have been shown to improve sleep quality. It's best to avoid consuming heavy, sugary, or spicy foods a few hours before bed.\n\n2. Stretching needs can vary depending on factors such as activity level, lifestyle, and past injuries. There is no set routine for stretching that works for everyone. However, stretching regularly can improve flexibility, improve range of motion, and decrease the risk of injury.\n\n  * At age 25, men generally have a better range of motion and flexibility. However, stretching can still help maintain this level of flexibility and prevent injuries.\n  * At age 30, men may start to notice some decrease in flexibility due to the natural aging process. Stretching can help prevent stiffness and injury.\n  * At age 35, men may start to notice some limitations in their range of motion, especially if they have a sedentary lifestyle. Stretching can help improve flexibility and overall physical function.\n  * At age 40, men may start to experience more stiffness and soreness due to decreasing flexibility. Regular stretching can help prevent injuries and maintain activity levels.\n  * At age 45, men may notice further decreases in flexibility and range of motion due to aging. Regular stretching can help reduce these limitations and improve function.\n\nOverall, the need to be flexible may vary by age, but it's important to maintain a regular stretching routine throughout adulthood to maintain mobility and reduce the risk of injury.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi thanks for contacting Chat Doctor.it depends upon individual.

But since you have started gaining power, it can continue for at least 6 more months, so my advise to you will be to continue with intensive physical therapy including muscle stimulation, vitamin B12 intake and come back to me with your neurological charting and MRI films so that i can see and advise you further.  <|endoftext|>"}

In the meantime, try to avoid activities that may make the floaters more noticeable, such as looking at bright lights or reading for extended periods.","answer_chatdoctor":"1) I would suggest that you get your vision checked by an eye specialist as this does sound like some kind of problem with your vision. 2) There are many causes of problems with vision, including cataracts, glaucoma, retinal issues (such as macular degeneration), optic nerve issues, etc. So it is important to get your eyes examined to determine what the cause is so that you can receive proper treatment.","text":"Instruct: Hi doctor,I feel a strange glitch in my vision.

The normal color of smegma varies depending upon the amount of exposure to air. It can range from light yellowish-brown to black. It is common for people to notice more smegma when they are sexually aroused. This is due to increased secretion of sebum from the sebaceous glands.

Based on the symptoms you have described in your daughter, there are a few possibilities that could be causing her stomach aches and frequent bowel movements:\n\n1) Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) - This is a common condition that affects the large intestine and can cause stomach pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. In children, IBS is often triggered by stress or anxiety.\n\n2) Food intolerance or allergy - Certain foods or beverages can cause stomach pain and frequent bowel movements if a person is sensitive to them. Common culprits include dairy, gluten, and high-fructose corn syrup.\n\n3) Gastrointestinal infection - Certain types of infections such as viral gastroenteritis or bacterial infections can cause stomach pain, diarrhea, and frequent bowel movements.\n\n4) Constipation - This may seem counterintuitive given the frequent bowel movements, but in some cases, a child's bowels can become impacted, leading to discomfort and stomach pain.\n\nGiven the recent onset of accidents and trouble feeling them coming, it is essential to rule out any physiological abnormalities or neurogenic bladder. It would be best to consult with a pediatric gastroenterologist to get a full workup to help diagnose her symptoms accurately.

Thank you for approaching me with your concern. Squint, also known as strabismus, is a condition where the eyes are misaligned, and they do not look in the same direction simultaneously. It is most commonly seen in children, but adults can also have it. The degree of squint can vary from mild to severe, and it can affect one or both eyes.\n\nThe fact that you have a squint and have difficulties with vision in your right eye is concerning. It would be best if you visited an eye specialist for a complete eye examination to determine the cause of your vision difficulties and the extent of your squint. Some conditions like cataract, amblyopia (lazy eye), or an eye injury can cause squint, and they need timely intervention.\n\nRegarding your concern about correction of squint, there's good news. It is possible to correct strabismus at any age, although treatment options may vary depending on the extent of the condition, presence of underlying eye problems, and age.\n\nThe treatment options for squint may include:\n\n1. Corrective lenses: wearing corrective lenses such as glasses or contact lenses can help in correcting eye refractive errors and aligning the eyes\n\n2. Eye muscle exercises: eye muscle exercises like eye patching, eye-tracking, and eye exercises can help to strengthen eye muscles and improve eye coordination\n\n3. Vision therapy: vision therapy involves assigning specific exercises that improve eye focusing, eye tracking, and eye teaming skills.\n\n4. Surgery: in severe cases, surgery may be required to correct misaligned eyes. In clinical settings, eye surgeons commonly employ procedures like strabismus surgery, which involves changing the strength or position of eye muscles to correct the gaze.\n\nIn conclusion, there are several options available for treating squint, regardless of age. You should visit an eye specialist, who will take you through the required tests and suggest the best possible option for your strabismus treatment.\n\nHope this helps.

It is really a very short description of your concern. It would be better if you would send me your detailed gynecological, menstrual, obstetric, medical and other histories. Which pill have you taken and how much dose? Had you confirmed your pregnancy status before having the pill? If not, have serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test) to have a clear idea about your pregnancy. On which date have you taken the pill and what was your last period date? If pregnancy is confirmed and it is early pregnancy, emergency contraceptive pills give with ChatDoctor.  Kindly send me your details so that I can guide you. In case of a positive pregnancy test, check again the level of beta hCG after 48 hours from the previous test. It will give us a clear idea about pregnancy progression or the effect of the pill on it as well. If the second level comes less than the previous it is a miscarriage. If the second level shows increase more than 60 % then it is a normal growing pregnancy. If the second level shows less then 60 % increase it is alarming and you need a transvaginal scan to exclude pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy).

It's great that you are taking an interest in your health and seeking medical advice.

So, while it is true that a heart rate of 98 bpm is on the higher end of the normal range, it does not necessarily mean that you have a medical condition. \n\nIt's also good news that your previous cardiac work-up, including EKG and Holter monitor, was normal.

","answer_chatgpt":"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic condition that affects the large intestine. The causes of IBS are not fully understood, but it is believed to be a combination of several factors. Some of these factors include:\n\n1. Changes in the gut microbiome: The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms that live in the digestive tract. Changes in the composition or diversity of these microorganisms can contribute to the development of IBS.\n\n2. Food sensitivities: Certain foods can trigger IBS symptoms, particularly FODMAPs (fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols). FODMAPs are a group of carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine and can lead to gas, bloating, and diarrhea.\n\n3. Stress and emotional factors: Stress and anxiety can worsen IBS symptoms, and many people with IBS report that their symptoms are triggered by emotional factors.\n\n4. Abnormalities in the nervous system: Abnormalities in the way the brain and the gut communicate with each other can lead to IBS.\n\n5. Muscle contractions in the intestine: Abnormal muscle contractions in the intestine, which can be caused by hormonal imbalances, medications or other factors, can contribute to IBS.\n\nThere is no cure for IBS, but it can be effectively managed with lifestyle changes and medication. The management of IBS usually involves diet modification, stress management, regular exercise, and medication. Your doctor may recommend a low-FODMAP diet, which involves avoiding certain foods that are high in FODMAPs. Other dietary interventions may include increasing fiber intake or avoiding certain trigger foods. Stress management techniques like meditation or cognitive-behavioral therapy can also be helpful. Medications such as antispasmodics or laxatives may be prescribed depending on the patient's symptoms. In some cases, psychological therapies such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or hypnotherapy may be recommended for long-term symptom control.

Please help.\nOutput: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. It is unlikely to be caused by i-pill. Does she has any underlying periods problem? It is probably not a permanent problem and she will have her periods soon. At this stage, we first need to rule out pregnancy. She should undergo a urine pregnancy test twice at an interval of 12 hours for confirmation. If it is negative, then she will need a detailed evaluation of the cause. She will need ultrasound pelvis for uterus and ovaries, and hormonal profile like thyroid function test, serum FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone). She should visit a gynecologist once for examination and for these investigations. Medicine could be initiated after ruling out the pregnancy and finding the cause. I hope this helps. <|endoftext|>"}

Adepix is a stimulant that is used for weight loss and can affect blood pressure, heart rate, and circulation. The use of Adepix may cause some complications during surgery, including interactions with anesthesia, increased risk of bleeding, and changes in heart rate or blood pressure.\n\nIt is possible that your surgeon requires a three-month period of not taking Adepix prior to surgery to ensure that these side effects have resolved before undergoing a major surgical procedure. This will help to minimize the risks associated with anesthesia and other potential complications.\n\nIt's important to discuss any concerns or questions you have with your surgeon about the use of Adepix prior to surgery.

Yes, your surgeon is correct.3-month gap between Adepix use & surgery is recommended.2. No, Adepix does not affect anesthesia.

In general, any medication that is used in long term should be stopped at least 7 days prior to surgery.

You need to maintain your thyroid levels below 2.5 mU\/L. The medicines you are taking are correct to keep your thyroid hormones under control. As far as prolactin is concerned, it will take some time to come down to the normal level. Once it is normal, then you may plan for conception.

What is missing in the follicular monitoring profile of the dummy cycle and also your husband\\s semen analysis test? You have been following the correct protocol using LH kits for ovulation and post LH surge if a natural trial or timed intercourse did not work then husband\\s semen analysis becomes mandatory. Then when both male and female infertility causes are ruled out then comes mechanical causes where positions and version of uterus need to be considered and measures implemented.

{"input":"Hello doctor,If I get my wisdom teeth extracted, do my second molars shift in that empty spot?","answer_icliniq":"Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. No, it will not shift to the empty space, but it might tilt and that too very little. Because the third molar is vestigial. If you have any associated problem with the third molar you can extract it. If you do not have any problem, do not remove it. In case you have any caries or repeated pericoronitis, you must remove it. My answer is no shifting but slight tilt only. For more information consult a dentist online ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello! Yes, it is possible for the second molars to shift into the empty spot left by the extracted wisdom teeth. The reason for this is that teeth tend to shift towards areas where there is less resistance or pressure. The wisdom teeth, being located towards the back of the mouth, provided some degree of pressure that helped to keep the second molars in place. When they are removed, there is no longer this pressure present, and the second molars can begin to shift slightly, causing some minor changes to the alignment of teeth. However, the extent to which this occurs can vary depending on a number of factors, including the individual's age, the nature of their bite, and the position and orientation of their remaining teeth.

Hope this helps you. Thanks!","text":"Instruct: Hello doctor,My friend started vomiting last night and I noticed that his eyelids were red and bruised. Is there something else besides the vomiting that could have caused the bruised eyelids?\nOutput: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. From the history provided, it seems that your friend is having red and bruised eyes following vomiting. This is probably because of rupture of very small blood vessels in the eyelids during vomiting.  This will not require any treatment and it will subside in one or two weeks, as the blood gets reabsorbed. Hence, you need not have to worry about this.Applying cold compression over the eyelids will provide symptomatic relief. Attach a photo of the affected eye and consult an ophthalmologist online for appropriate treatment <|endoftext|>"}

But the second one on the bottom which is much smaller still has completely white color and around the vagina blades, I have a little while dots. Also, there are very tiny warts line along the blades. So, when I went to see the GP near my house he had a look and said that there is nothing to worry it is still small.

Wait till the paint ","answer_chatgpt":"Hi there,\n\nI understand that you have several concerns and questions regarding the warts you have discovered in your vagina. I will try my best to provide you with useful information.\n\nFirstly, it is highly likely that the warts you have are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a sexually transmitted infection. However, not all HPV infections cause warts. The virus can lay dormant in your body for years without causing any symptoms.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no cure for HPV, but there are ways to manage and treat the symptoms. The Condyline paint prescribed to you is one of the treatments available for genital warts. It is important to use it correctly to avoid any complications. The instruction leaflet that comes with the medication should provide you with detailed information on how to use it. You should also follow up with your GP if there are any concerns or if the symptoms persist after the treatment.\n\nThe Gardasil vaccine is available to prevent some strains of HPV that cause genital warts and certain types of cancer. However, it does not work for people who are already infected with HPV at the time of vaccination. It is recommended for girls and boys to receive the vaccine before they become sexually active to provide the best protection.\n\nUsing condoms during sexual activity can lower the risk of contracting HPV, but it is not foolproof. HPV can spread through skin-to-skin contact, so condoms may not always cover all the affected areas. It is also possible to contract HPV through oral sex, so it is important to practice safe sex all the time and to get regular screening tests.\n\nBreaking up with your boyfriend may not necessarily help with the symptoms or prevent future outbreaks. HPV can be passed on even if the infected person appears healthy and may not even know they have the virus. The key is to maintain good hygiene practices and to get regular screenings.\n\nThe HPV virus can sometimes lead to cancer, but this is not always the case. Women who have had HPV-related genital warts are at a slightly higher risk of developing cervical cancer, so it is important to get regular cervical cancer screening tests as advised by your doctor.\n\nOnce the warts are gone, it is safe to resume sexual activity, but there is a chance that the symptoms may come back. This is because the virus may still be present in your body, and there is no cure for HPV. Continuing to practice safe sex and maintaining good hygiene practices can help reduce the risk of future outbreaks.\n\nIf you decide to get the Gardasil vaccine, it is okay to have sexual activity during the vaccination periods, but it is important to note that the vaccine may not provide the best protection if you are already infected with HPV.\n\nI hope this information helps. It is important to have open communication with your doctor about your concerns and to follow their advice regarding treatment and prevention.","answer_chatdoctor":"1.

However, I can provide some general information and guidance.\n\nAlthough your labs and tests are normal, it's still possible that you are experiencing some sort of arrhythmia. There are many different types of arrhythmias, and some can be difficult to detect on routine ECG or Holter monitor. Additionally, it's possible that you are experiencing a sensation of palpitations without actually having any significant arrhythmia. This can be caused by anxiety or stress.\n\nPropranolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to treat arrhythmias or palpitations. It works by slowing down your heart rate and reducing the force of your heart's contractions. However, as you noted, beta-blockers can also have proarrhythmic effects. This means that they can sometimes cause or worsen arrhythmias, especially in people with certain underlying conditions.\n\nGiven your history of a possible heart attack or arrhythmia, as well as your ongoing symptoms, it may be worth considering further testing or evaluation. This could include a more extended or continuous monitoring period, such as an implantable loop recorder. Additionally, if your symptoms are truly bothersome or affecting your quality of life, treatment options beyond beta-blockers may be worth exploring.\n\nIn terms of how to take the propranolol, it's best to follow your doctor's specific instructions. If they prescribed it to be taken daily, it's likely because they feel that you will benefit from its effects on an ongoing basis. However, if you are only experiencing occasional symptoms, it may be reasonable to take it as needed, under the supervision of your doctor.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, Palpitations and other symptoms are suggestive of anxiety.

All labs are normal ECG, echo, and Holter monitor are all normal.Doctor cannot figure it out and prescribed Propranolol 10 mg, told me to try these once a day. Yesterday after doctor visits heart palpitations for four hours got fed up and took one tablet one hour later, all palpitations and adrenaline rush was gone. Slept for the first time without being woke up having to cough to stop the palpitations. Had angio done approximately two years ago due to suspected heart attack or arrhythmia at home with all classic signs crushing chest pain jaw neck left arm down to the floor nauseated?Even with that lab test came back good the next day. Had carotid artery surgery two years ago to remove a piece of plaque in right carotid artery none found anywhere else no stent needed. Again all labs are good cholesterol not high on statins and warfarin. I must be perplexing to all doctors because they cannot figure it out. Was put on warfarin approximately 15 years ago due to DVTs as a result of a surgery, always therapeutic. So I had a heart attack or arrhythmia a few years back the angio came out the great doctor said everything looked fine now I have these crazy heart palpitations that would not stop. They go away as soon as I take the beta-blocker. I am told that beta-blockers even though anti-arrhythmic can also be pro arithmetic as well should I take this every day or should I only take this when I start to feel palpitations.\nOutput: Hello, Welcome to ciliniq.com. So palpitations may be due to cardiac arrhythmia, anxiety, and psychological problems or due to increased awareness of one\\s heartbeat. Now, since your holter was normal during your palpitations, it rules out the possibility of cardiac arrhythmia. So, these are likely benign palpitations in you. Propranolol is an anti-anxiety medicine, and it also opposes the A ChatDoctor.  It is not an antiarrhythmic  Take care.<|endoftext|>"}
{"input":"Hi doctor,I am a 49-year-old woman and last month I was hospitalized with a necrotizing soft tissue infection on my thigh. I had two debridement surgeries and was discharged after 5 days. I was treated with about 4 IV antibiotics. I do not remember them all, I recall seeing Vancomycin and Penicillin. I was told that the infection was not MRSA, but a \"slower moving bacteria\" they did not tell me what it was. I was swabbed for MRSA in my nose and butt before both surgeries and was told I did not have it. For the last day of my stay, I had a roommate who had a bad MRSA infection on her butt and sometimes had diarrhea incontinence during dressing changes. I had no physical contact with her, but we had the same nurse. I was discharged with a five day course of Augmentin.The wound has been healing very well and has not gotten infected, but three weeks after discharge I got an abscess under my arm. I went to an urgent care and was prescribed Clindamycin and told to return in three days for drainage. The abscess did not improve or get worse over the three days. I got it drained and was prescribed Augmentin and told to also continue the clindamycin. That was a week ago and the wound is healing well. They called today and said cultures show it was MRSA and they prescribed Bactrim and told me to stop the other antibiotics.I am feeling devastated by this and wanting to understand why it happened. Could I have gotten it in the hospital? I am concerned that it will not go away. Are those swabs at the hospital conclusive and mean for sure I did not have MRSA a month ago? I have never had any medical problems before and these experiences have been very frightening. Is there anything else I can do to prevent recurrence?

","answer_chatgpt":"I understand that this has been a frightening experience for you. It is possible that you may have acquired MRSA in the hospital, even if the swabs did not detect it at the time. MRSA can be carried on the skin without causing an infection, and it is possible for it to develop into an infection later on. Additionally, being in close proximity with a patient with MRSA may have increased your risk of acquiring it.\n\nIn terms of preventing future recurrence, practicing good hygiene, such as washing your hands frequently, using bleach baths or hibiclens, and using antibiotics in the nose may be helpful. It may also be important to maintain good overall health, as people with weakened immune systems or underlying medical conditions may be more prone to infections.\n\nIt is important to continue taking the prescribed antibiotics as directed and follow up with your healthcare provider as instructed. They can monitor your progress and provide additional guidance and treatment as needed.","answer_chatdoctor":"1) MRSA is a superbug and is resistant to most of the antibiotics in use today. It is spread through direct contact with the skin lesions of someone carrying the bug or through contact with contaminated surfaces. Most hospitals routinely screen patients for MRSA colonization of their nasal cavity, mouth, and anal region.2) MRSA is usually resistant to penicillin and vancomycin, so if your infections were treated with those medications then you probably didn't have MRSA.3) You can take measures to avoid getting MRSA again like using hand sanitizer frequently, keeping your hands clean, doing regular baths with bleach water, avoiding contact with people who have visible skin lesions, wearing gloves when touching broken skin, etc. Hope this helps","text":"Instruct: Hi doctor,I am a 49-year-old woman and last month I was hospitalized with a necrotizing soft tissue infection on my thigh.

Consult a radiologist online to know about the risk levels of radiation exposure ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello, I understand your concern. It is true that CT scans involve exposure to ionizing radiation, which can increase your risk of cancer. However, the risk is generally very small and the benefits usually outweigh the risks.\n\nThe radiation dose from a CT scan varies depending on the type of exam, the area of the body being scanned, and the individual patient's size and age. In general, the radiation dose from two separate CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis would be higher than from a single scan.\n\nIt is difficult to estimate your individual risk of developing cancer from these scans, as it depends on many factors. However, the American College of Radiology has stated that the increased risk from a typical CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is estimated to be low, with a potential lifetime risk of fatal cancer estimated to be 0.1%. This means that out of 1,000 people who undergo such scans, one might die from radiation-induced cancer.\n\nIt is important to remember that CT scans are extremely useful diagnostic tools that can help detect potentially life-threatening conditions, such as lymphoma. In cases where the benefits of the scan outweigh the risks, it is important to undergo the scan.\n\nIf you are still concerned, you can talk to your doctor about ways to reduce your radiation exposure, such as using alternative imaging techniques, such as MRI or ultrasound, or by using lower-dose CT protocols.","answer_chatdoctor":"1) There is no proven link between cancer and radiation exposure. 2) The amount of radiation used in these CT scans is so small that it can not cause any harm to your health.3) Cancer takes many years to develop, and if there is a chance of developing cancer then it would have developed by now.4) Do not worry.","text":"Instruct: Hello doctor,I am a 26 year old female.

IntraLasik is a method in which the corneal flap is taken by laser. In regular Lasik, the corneal flap is taken by a mechanical device which has a metal blade. The rest of the procedures are the same. Contoura vision is a personalized Lasik in which the laser correction is done according to the size and specifications of the individual\\s eye. It is something like getting a shirt specially stitched to the individual\\s size, whereas regular Lasik is like buying a ready-made shirt. ","answer_chatgpt":"IntraLASIK and Contoura LASIK are both advanced technologies used in laser eye surgery to correct refractive errors such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. However, they are slightly different from each other.\n\nIntraLASIK, also known as Bladeless LASIK, is a femtosecond laser-assisted LASIK surgery. It involves creating a corneal flap using a femtosecond laser instead of a microkeratome blade, as in traditional LASIK. This technology is known for its precision and reduces the risk of complications during the procedure.\n\nContoura LASIK, on the other hand, is a type of custom LASIK procedure that uses topography-guided laser technology. It creates a detailed map of the cornea, including all of its subtle irregularities, and uses this information to make highly precise laser treatment patterns. This technology can provide better outcomes for patients with highly irregular corneas, such as those with keratoconus.\n\nIn summary, IntraLASIK is a variation of LASIK that uses a laser to create the corneal flap, while Contoura LASIK is a custom LASIK procedure that uses topography-guided laser technology.

IntraLASIK uses a femtosecond laser instead of a microkeratome to create a flap in the cornea. This laser is more precise than the microkeratome and can be programmed for individualized treatment plans.

Fungal infections usually take two months to resolve completely provided you take proper dose of medicine for the prescribed duration. Terbinaforce (Terbinafine) is a good antifungal. Both tablets Terbinaforce and Sebifin (Terbinafine) cream have the same  ChatDoctor.  I suggest if you have taken Terbinaforce for one month then it is sufficient. I would suggest you switch to Seriva cream (Sertaconazole Topical), a newer antifungal. Apply this cream twice a day, in the morning after taking bath and in the night before going to bed. You also can use KZ soap (Ketoconazole). Use only for thigh area while taking bath. Use your regular soap for rest of the body. You can also use Abzorb Dusting Powder. Apply it to the thigh area after you apply Seriva cream. This will reduce sweating and friction. Along with that, I need you to follow few do\\s and don\\ts.

Any trauma to the tooth generally has long-term consequences like tooth discoloration, etc. As you said that your tooth was fractured, it might have led to a slight injury to the pulp or even if not so, the fracture line would have been close to the pulp. In both cases, the pulp over time starts to become non-vital sometimes due to injury and sometimes due to the restorative material lying in close proximity to the pulp. This over time results in the discoloration of the tooth. The characteristic feature of this discoloration will be that only the involved tooth will be discolored and other teeth will be normal or not discolored.

It is generally not associated with any kind of pain as the process is chronic and takes time to set in. I would advise you to have a visit to your nearest dentist. He would prescribe a vitality test of the tooth and also would get an x-ray for the tooth. By that way, he would come to know if the tooth is dead or still vital and accordingly will propose treatment. If the tooth is vital, he will put some medication over the pulp to let it heal and then fill with the pulp friendly restoration.

Meanwhile, keep your oral hygiene good, brush twice daily and floss regularly. Use mouth rinses to clean the mouth after meals. <|endoftext|>"}
{"input":"Hi doctor,I have been wearing braces for teeth alignment. I am towards the end of my treatment and have developed a high pitched sound in my right ear. I consulted with my orthodontist and temporarily removed the wires on two occasions. Both times, the ringing went down after some weeks. When I put on again, the sound started. One ENT I consulted said it could be an allergy to dust in the area I live in. Based on the information I received and the symptoms, I am not sure how to proceed. What is the cause of this issue?","answer_icliniq":"Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. Tinnitus due to braces is not possible. Tinnitus can be due to many reasons like hearing loss, or nerve loss, or any loud noise exposure, or trauma to the ear, or even nasal infection, or some medicines. Please tell me do you have any relevant history? Dental procedures that involve the use of dental burs can cause tinnitus but not just the braces. You should get pure tone audiometry done and follow up with the required information so that I can suggest you better. ","answer_chatgpt":"There are a few potential causes of the high pitched sound in your right ear that could be related to your braces:\n\n1. Bruxism: Bruxism is teeth grinding or clenching, which can be a common side effect of braces. This can put pressure on your jaw joint, which can cause ringing in your ears. Your orthodontist may suggest a mouthguard to help address this.\n\n2. Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Disorder: TMJ disorder is a condition that affects the joint that connects your jaw to your skull. This can cause pain, difficulty chewing, and ringing in your ears. It's possible that wearing braces has exacerbated this condition.\n\n3. Allergy: As your ENT suggested, it's possible that the ringing in your ear is related to an allergy. This could be due to dust or other allergens in your environment. If this is the case, you may want to consider taking allergy medications or making changes to your living environment to reduce exposure to allergens.\n\n4. Tinnitus: Tinnitus is a common condition where people hear ringing, buzzing, or other noises in their ears. This can be caused by a variety of factors, including exposure to loud noises, stress, or certain medications. It's possible that wearing braces has exacerbated an existing case of tinnitus.\n\nIt's important to continue working with your orthodontist and ENT to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. They may recommend additional testing or refer you to a specialist if necessary. In the meantime, you may want to try techniques for managing tinnitus, such as mindfulness meditation or sound therapy.","answer_chatdoctor":"1stly your ears are quite far from each other so there is no chance of any interference between them.2ndly if you were having hearing problem then you would have noticed that.3rdly you had taken off the appliance and the sound came back so it is unlikely to be related to the appliances.4thly if it was due to allergies then it should have subsided by now.5thly there can be many reasons like TMJ dysfunction or cervical spondylitis etc. but for these you need to take x-rays of the relevant areas.6thly the sound may be due to bone changes associated with aging which will require radiographs of the area.7thly the sound may also be because of auditory nerve pathology and this requires audiometry tests.8thly the sound may be due to a vascular cause and this requires Doppler studies.

{"input":"Hello doctor,Looking for an opinion on tuberculosis skin test. Please answer if you have experience with PPD skin tests. I am 34 years old, former cigarette smoker.

","answer_chatgpt":"I am an AI language model and do not have the ability to view any images. However, as an AI language model, I can tell you that the tuberculosis skin test, or PPD test, is a commonly used method to diagnose tuberculosis infection. The test involves injecting a small amount of purified protein derivative (PPD) under the skin and then checking the injection site for a reaction after 48-72 hours. If a raised red bump appears at the site, it may indicate a previous or current tuberculosis infection. In your case, it would be best to consult with a healthcare provider who can review the results of your skin test and provide an accurate diagnosis based on your medical history and physical examination.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, I would like to know which part of your body you had this test done? The test is positive only when there is a reaction at least 10 mm in size. There should be no other lesion in that area as well. You might need to repeat the test after few weeks.

{"input":"Hello doctor,I am 22 years old. I have been on the following antidepressants for two years. Morning: Modapex 50 one pill, Depakene, Lamotrigine 25 mg one pill. Night: Clozapex 25 mg half a pill, Mirtimash 30 g half a pill, Depakine Chrono 500 mg one pill, and Anafranil 75 mg half a pill.I used to take more but I stopped them over the past two years. For example, I used to take double the mentioned dose about nine months ago. I recovered from depression a couple of months ago. I started detoxing but with my doctor, the process was going way too slow and I have gained 45 kilograms over the past two years (25 in the past two months alone!) my muscles, my bones, and my joints started to hurt really bad because of my weight. Nothing works. I go to the gym every day, I workout but still I eat way too much because of the drugs and I cannot control it. My doctor does not want me to stop despite every hardship that I face and even refuses to decrease half a pill from the prescription. However, three weeks ago, I decided to cut all medications once and for all. I lost 7 kilograms, I stopped eating too much and just by cutting down the drugs I saved not less than 1800 calories per day. I started going to the gym more regularly. But here is the problem.Clozapex 25 and Mirtimash make me sleep and without them, I cannot sleep. No kidding, I have not slept in the past three weeks more than a maximum of 70 hours. Even those 70 hours, they are full of nightmares and I usually wake up after two hours with my mind confused and afraid and I cannot sleep back. I want to sleep.

I thought that after three weeks it would get easier but it is not getting easier. I have no side effects at all from any of the drugs only the disturbance of sleep.

Another option would be to discuss with your doctor the possibility of switching to different medications that may be less likely to disrupt your sleep, or adding other medications that can help promote sleep. There are also non-pharmacological interventions that can be helpful, such as relaxation techniques or cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia.\n\nIt is important to remember that medication alone is rarely a complete solution to mental health concerns, and that ongoing support and treatment may be necessary to address underlying issues and promote overall wellness.

Based on what you have shared, it sounds like you have a complex history with your right ear and some issues with your left ear as well.\n\nAdhesive otitis is a condition where the middle ear space becomes filled with a sticky fluid that can cause hearing loss and ear infections. SOM stands for serous otitis media which is another type of middle ear fluid that can cause hearing loss and pressure sensations in the ear.\n\nA mastoidectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the air cells in the mastoid bone behind the ear in order to prevent or treat infections that have spread from the middle ear. Myringotomy is a procedure to create a small hole in the eardrum in order to drain fluids that have built up.\n\nTo properly evaluate your condition and develop a treatment plan, it would be helpful to review your CT scan, audiometry, and impedance test results. If it has been a while since your last evaluation, it may also be necessary to perform additional tests to fully understand the current status of your ears.\n\nI would recommend scheduling an appointment with an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist to discuss your options and develop a plan for managing your condition. Depending on the severity of your symptoms, treatment may involve medications, additional surgeries, or the use of hearing aids.\n\nI hope this information is helpful, and I wish you the best of luck in finding relief from your symptoms.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor. I understand your concern regarding the hearing loss. The most common causes for hearing loss are Otis media and OTIS externa.

OTIS external is an infection of ear canal. It is usually caused by fungus. It leads to conductive hearing loss also. You should consult ENT specialist and get evaluated.

If it is painful to roll the skin over the glans, I suggest using Lignocaine gel and pull it front. After that, the swelling will slowly subside. If red discoloration also is present, then it can be a hematoma. Please share a picture. Revert with more information to a urologist online <|endoftext|>"}

As an AI language model, I am not a doctor and I cannot interpret your specific symptoms. However, I can provide general information about the common cold and tips to reduce your risk of getting one.\n\n1. Why we are getting frequent colds?\n\nThe common cold is caused by a viral infection in the upper respiratory tract. There are many different types of cold viruses, so it's possible to catch a cold multiple times in a year. In addition, some people may be more susceptible to colds due to a weaker immune system or exposure to cold and flu viruses in their environment.\n\n2. What can be done to reduce the amount of colds we are getting?\n\nThere are several things you can do to reduce your risk of catching a cold:\n\n- Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, especially before eating or after being in contact with someone who is sick.\n- Avoid touching your face, especially your eyes, nose, and mouth, as this can transfer cold viruses from your hands to your respiratory system.\n- Stay away from people who are sick, and avoid crowded areas if possible.\n- Boost your immune system by eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and exercising regularly.\n- Consider getting an annual flu shot, which can help protect against some strains of the flu virus that can also cause cold-like symptoms.\n\nIf you do catch a cold, it's important to rest, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid spreading the virus to others by covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze.","answer_chatdoctor":"3. Can you suggest any medication which will help in reducing the frequency of colds?1. I am sorry to say that there is no way to prevent or cure colds completely. Colds are caused by viruses and they have their own innate immunity to fight against them and therefore, antibiotics do not work for them. The best thing one can do is to avoid exposing oneself to cold and other irritants like smokes and dusts. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water and clean your face also. Use handkerchief while sneezing and coughing instead of hands so as to avoid spreading the virus. Take plenty of fluids, eat healthy diet and take multivitamin supplements daily. Hope this information helps you. Thank you.","text":"Instruct: Hello doctor,1. Why we are getting frequent colds?2.

My opinion is you should go for extraction along with cyst removal because third-time root canal of the same tooth is not a good idea. Periodontitis is nothing but an infection of gum tissue which is totally curable and depends upon your oral hygiene. Bone resorption is a kind of bone loss due to demineralization.

Warts and molluscum are common sexually acquired infections and can occur in healthy individuals. Warts spread by touch and condoms will only protect the covered area. Base of the penis, thighs, lower abdomen are all exposed. So, both warts and molluscum can be transmitted even with condom usage. For treatment, I suggest you Imiquimod 5% cream.

Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take treatment with consent. Also, you should get tested for HIV and hepatitis. ","answer_chatgpt":"Genital warts are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), which is highly contagious and can be spread through sexual contact. Even though you have always used a condom during sexual intercourse, there is still a risk of transmission of HPV, as the virus can be present on areas not covered by the condom, such as the scrotum, vulva, and anus.\n\nIt is also possible for the virus to remain in the body for a long time after initial infection without causing any symptoms. So it is possible that you may have contracted the virus some time ago without realizing it.\n\nIn terms of your treatment, it is important to continue taking the medication as prescribed by your doctor. Dicaris is often used to stimulate the body's immune system to fight the HPV infection. Additionally, the use of Zincolak and Zycolchin may help to boost your immune system, which can also aid in fighting the virus.\n\nIt is important to note that there is currently no cure for HPV, so treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms and reducing the risk of transmission to others. Even after warts are removed, there is always a chance of recurrence.\n\nTo reduce your risk of future infections and to prevent transmission to others, it is important to practice safe sex by using a condom during sexual intercourse and limiting your number of sexual partners. You may also want to discuss the HPV vaccine with your doctor, as it can help to protect against certain strains of the virus.\n\nFinally, it's important to follow up with your doctor regularly to monitor your condition and ensure that treatment is working effectively.","answer_chatdoctor":"1.

Based on your symptoms, there are a few possibilities for what could be causing this pain.\n\nOne possibility is a condition known as Costochondritis. This is an inflammation of the cartilage that connects your ribs to your breastbone. The pain can radiate into your armpit and arm, and it can feel like a sharp, stabbing pain. Treatment for this condition typically involves rest, over-the-counter pain medications, and heat or ice therapy.\n\nAnother possibility is a pinched nerve. The tingling and numbness in your arm could be a sign of nerve compression in your neck or shoulder. This can be caused by poor posture, repetitive motions, or injury. Treatment for this condition typically involves physical therapy, chiropractic care, and\/or pain medications.\n\nIt's also possible that this pain could be related to breast cancer, although it's important to note that breast cancer typically does not cause pain until it's in advanced stages. However, it's always important to be proactive when it comes to your breast health. I would recommend scheduling an appointment with your healthcare provider so they can perform a physical examination and possibly order imaging tests like a mammogram or ultrasound to rule out any serious conditions.\n\nIn the meantime, you may find relief by taking over-the-counter pain medications, applying heat or ice to the affected area, and avoiding any activities that worsen your symptoms.

If you do not take measures at this time you may need RCT (root canal treatment) which will be 10 to 20 expensive and not as successful as filling. On your upper tooth, the line I understand is the gingival recession with abrasion, if you are right handed it must be on the left side or the side you keep your teeth brushing continuously. For this, you only need to use an ultrasoft toothbrush and check the video for modified Bass technique for tooth brushing. Also brush your teeth twice daily and keep the brush time of two to three minutes only.  For more information consult a dentist online <|endoftext|>"}

{"input":"Hello doctor,You were wonderful in allaying some health anxiety over some skin issues several months ago. So, I thought I would consult with you on another question pertaining to my son. Unfortunately, a combination of my health anxiety and the big mistake of searching online has my mind imagining the worst with regard to my son. My son is 19 years old and has no diagnosed medical issues. I noticed back when he was about eight or ten years old that he had a mark resembling a cafe au lait mark on his back, in the upper shoulder area. I had always asked the pediatrician to look at it during his yearly physicals, and they made nothing of it. Throughout the years it has grown a bit and has become darker and more rough in texture. It is probably slightly less than an inch in length and looks like a few small lesions grouped together. Again, I have brought it to the pediatrician\\s attention and he was not concerned. Three months ago, I made an appointment for him and my other son with a dermatologist for a skin exam, and I pointed out the spots which I wanted to be checked in particular. We met with the physician\\s assistant there, and my younger son had a peculiar spot I pointed out, of which the PA conducted a shave biopsy, which came back as a mildly atypical junctional nevus. For my older son, I pointed out the spot on his back\/shoulder, and the PA diagnosed it as a linear epidermal nevus. She said the chances of it becoming dangerous are slim to none. It may darken throughout the years, and they will simply monitor it at yearly visits. Unfortunately, I went on to research online about epidermal nevi and of course I ran into information showing a possible link to epidermal nevus syndrome and all of its associated neurological and skeletal defects. As I said, he is 19 and has no medical issues, is extremely intelligent, etc. In your opinion, is it safe to say that I should not be concerned about those syndromes? I presume it is primarily related to the numerous and systemic epidermal nevi, which he does not have, and I would think it would have presented by now? And my last even more neurotic question. My online research led me to some information saying that a certain type of epidermal nevus could be related to a gene mutation that could be passed along to an offspring, with them having possible serious skin scaling conditions, etc. Again, he has just one solitary small epidermal nevus. No biopsy was done, as the PA did not feel it was necessary. Do you feel there is any need for me to worry about that potential genetic mutation? Thank you so much for reading my long query.","answer_icliniq":"Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. A solitary epidermal nevus is very common and does not pose any kind of serious health concern. Neither is a biopsy required. You are right. Any associated symptom should have been present since birth or early childhood in this case. Even if it is passed on to the future generations, it is harmless. A yearly medical examination is more than enough for the nevi in both your kids. Good luck. ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello! I am happy to help address your concerns. Based on what you\u2019ve described, it sounds like your son has a single linear epidermal nevus, which is a benign skin lesion. These are caused by a genetic mutation in the embryonic development of the skin and are not generally associated with any other medical conditions. While epidermal nevus syndrome can be associated with multiple and widespread epidermal nevi, your son\u2019s single lesion does not suggest that he has this syndrome. Additionally, even if he did have epidermal nevus syndrome, the associated neurological and skeletal defects are not typically present until infancy or childhood, so it is unlikely that he would develop these conditions at his current age.\n\nIn terms of passing on a gene mutation to his offspring, the risk is generally low, especially if there is only one isolated lesion. While some epidermal nevi can be associated with specific gene mutations, this is not always the case and may not be relevant to your son\u2019s condition. It is still a good idea to continue monitoring the lesion as recommended by his dermatologist, but there is no need to worry about him passing on any significant genetic risk to his offspring.\n\nI hope this information helps to ease your concerns. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I can understand your concern regarding your sons health problem. There is no need to worry about this issue. The epidermal nevus is benign condition which occurs due to abnormal pigmentation of the skin. It doesn't spread anywhere else in the body, and it won't cause any harmful effects. Epidermal nevi don't usually cause problems unless they change color, size or shape. But if you are worried about it then you can see a dermatologist and get evaluated. Hope you find this answer helpful. Wishing you good health.

From your description, I understand that the first time you had a problem with your left leg was due to a sprain (talofibular ligament) around the ankle and it got resolved.

","answer_chatgpt":"Hello! I understand your concern about your left leg pain and decreased flow in the left anterior tibial artery. The arterial Doppler ultrasound and D-dimer test are reliable diagnostic tests for identifying arterial blood clots, particularly in the legs. The fact that your D-dimer test was negative, along with no stenosis and sclerosis seen on your Doppler ultrasound, makes it unlikely that you have peripheral artery disease or a blood clot. The previous talofibular ligament sprain could have caused the decreased flow, but it is encouraging that it returned to normal after three months.\n\nIt is good to hear that you do not have any major risk factors for peripheral artery disease. However, since you are still experiencing some pain and coldness in your left leg and foot, it would be best to have a follow-up with your doctor or a vascular specialist for a more thorough evaluation. Pain in your buttocks that goes down your leg similar to sciatic pain could be related to a nerve or disc issue rather than arterial disease. Additional tests such as nerve conduction studies, nerve root imaging, or a CT or MRI scan of your lumbar spine may be required to better understand the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIt is safe to fly for the majority of people with peripheral artery disease, as long as precautions are taken to avoid deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Steps you can take to minimize the risk of developing DVT while flying include walking around every hour, doing exercises while seated, staying adequately hydrated, and wearing compression stockings. You should discuss your travel plans with your doctor to determine if flying poses any risk in your specific case.\n\nLastly, while high LDL cholesterol can contribute to the development of peripheral artery disease, it is not the sole cause. Other risk factors, such as hypertension and smoking, can also contribute to the development of the disease. Therefore, keeping your overall cardiovascular risk factors under control is essential in preventing peripheral arterial disease.\n\nI hope this information helps you!","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. As you describe, all your reports are within normal range except LDL. The problem with LDL is that most people do not know their level until they take a test. Even if your LDL level is slightly higher than what is considered normal, it does not mean that you will get heart attack or stroke. You should discuss with your cardiologist about the need for medications to reduce your cholesterol levels. Regarding your symptoms, I would suggest taking medication such as pregabalin or gabapentin which can give relief from pain. If these medicines fail to relieve your symptoms, you may require further investigations including angiography. Hope this helps. Take care.","text":"Instruct: Hi doctor,I am a 33 year old female.

This result means that you have undergone testicular insufficiecy, failure which means that testis in your body are not producing enough testosterone hormone to complete the process of sperm formation. Testicular insufficiency is being conformed by the elevated levels of FSH and LH which are being shown in your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). ","answer_chatgpt":"Azoospermia is a medical condition in which there is no sperm in the ejaculate. The three hormones you mention play a major role in the production and maturation of sperm cells in the testicles.\n\nFSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) is produced by the pituitary gland and stimulates the growth and maturation of the sperm cells in the testicles. In your case, the FSH level is high, which indicates that the pituitary gland is trying to stimulate the testicles to produce more sperm cells.\n\nLH (luteinizing hormone) is also produced by the pituitary gland, but this hormone stimulates the production of testosterone in the testicles. In your case, the LH level is also high, which indicates that the pituitary gland is trying to stimulate the testicles to produce more testosterone.\n\nTestosterone is the male hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics, including the growth and maturation of the sperm cells in the testicles. In your case, the testosterone level is low, which indicates that the testicles may not be producing enough testosterone to support the growth and maturation of the sperm cells.\n\nIn summary, your test results suggest that you have azoospermia, and that your pituitary gland is trying to stimulate your testicles to produce more sperm cells and testosterone. However, your testicles may not be functioning properly, and that could be a possible cause of your condition. Further evaluation and consultation with a urologist or reproductive endocrinologist is recommended to determine the exact cause of your azoospermia and the appropriate treatment options.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, dear, thanks for your question. I have gone through your question and understand your concerns. Azoospermia means there is no sperms in the semen.

This further suggests that there might be some obstruction in the pathway of transportation of sperms from the testis towards the ejaculate. So consult an urologist and get evaluated properly.

While it is true that glaucoma is more common in older individuals, it can still occur in younger people, especially if there is a family history of the disease. \n\nIt is important to note that high eye pressure is just one of many risk factors for glaucoma. Other factors include family history, ethnicity, age, and previous eye injuries. So, even if your doctor is not seeing any damage to your optic nerve at this point, it is still important to monitor your eye pressure regularly and to continue to get regular eye exams.\n\nI would recommend getting a second opinion from another eye doctor, preferably one who specializes in glaucoma. They may want to perform additional tests, such as a visual field test or an optic nerve scan, to get a better idea of what is going on with your eyes. It is always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to your vision health.","answer_chatdoctor":"1) It seems from your history that your eye pressure is always high.

He at first told me everything looked good until I asked him what my pressure was again because he specifically said my pressure was good when I knew that it was high. He told me that it was fairly high when I asked for it but he says I do not have any optic nerve damage and that it is highly unlikely that I have glaucoma because I am 23 years old. But my research has told me differently that high eye pressure alone does not mean that that you have glaucoma but if you have visual field loss or optic nerve damage with your high eye pressure then you do. So I do not know what is going on? Can you please help me understand and is it possible that I do have glaucoma and should go to another doctor?\nOutput: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I reviewed your history. The presence of elevated intraocular pressure is called as ocular hypertension. If it is associated with visual field changes or optic disc changes it is called as glaucoma.

It sounds like he may be experiencing some discomfort due to the gas and reflux. \n\nOne thing you could try is eliminating the formula and sticking with only pumped milk. Some babies have a hard time digesting formula, and it can cause gas and spit-up. It may take a few days to see if this helps, but it is something to consider.\n\nAnother thing to try is to make sure your baby is getting a good burp after every feeding. Sometimes babies need to be burped multiple times during a feeding. You could also try holding him in an upright position for 20-30 minutes after a feeding to help with reflux.\n\nIn terms of the lack of bowel movements, it is not uncommon for breastfed babies to go several days without a bowel movement.

However, every baby is unique and may respond differently.

In addition, a spirometry test may be normal in the early stages of the disease.\n\nIn order to get a clearer picture of the nature of the scarring in your lung, your healthcare provider may recommend further testing such as a CT scan, pulmonary function tests, and\/or a biopsy if appropriate.

However, there are many different types of scarring and they don't all behave the same way. The most common type of scar seen in lungs (and other organs) is called fibrosis. This is when the body repairs itself by forming collagen, which forms dense tissue. Fibrotic scars can be very bad if they form too much collagen, however this doesn't happen in most cases.2) Your doctor was correct to say that this was likely due to an old infection. Infections can cause some degree of scarring, and these are usually reversible.3) It is possible that your scarring is related to IPF, but this would require further testing such as CT scan or bronchoscopy to rule out other causes.

Depending on the severity of the recession, treatment options may include scaling and root planing, gum grafting, or surgical intervention. \n\nIt is also important to maintain good oral hygiene practices, including brushing gently twice a day and using a soft-bristled toothbrush, flossing daily, and attending regular dental check-ups and cleanings.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, Thanks for your query. It could be due to either of the following reasons-1. Gingival recession2. Improper brushing technique3. Trauma4. Poor oral hygiene. You can consult a Dentist and get evaluated. You will need to do a complete evaluation which includes clinical examination and radiographs if required. After proper diagnosis treatment can be planned accordingly.","text":"Instruct: Hello doctor,On the my bottom my two front teeth the gums have came up over them but not covered. But the gum is higher up than it is in any other teeth in my mouth. What caused this? Can I fix this in home itself?\nOutput: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. That condition of your gum is called localized gingivitis. It occurs because of the deposition of calculus and plaque on your teeth and inside the gums margins, which causes inflammation of gums that enlarged in size. The first treatment is ideally you should visit a dentist and get the scaling, cleaning, and polishing done. Once your teeth and gums get cleaned, after you will have to maintain your hygiene, then after a few days it will become totally fine. Right now at home you can do proper brushing and flossing and do warm saline i.e. warm water and salt rinses daily, it will heal slowly, but scaling is genuinely required. I hope this helps. <|endoftext|>"}

But it remits on its own. ","answer_chatgpt":"There are a few possible reasons why your wife experienced bleeding after having sex for the first time. Some of these reasons may include:\n\n1. Vaginal tearing - The first time you have sex, your partner's penis may stretch your wife's hymen or cause small tears in the vaginal tissue. This can cause minor bleeding.\n\n2. Cervical or vaginal infection - An infection can cause irritation and inflammation, which can cause bleeding after sex. \n\n3. Hormonal changes - Fluctuations in hormones during your wife's menstrual cycle can cause thinning of the vaginal lining, making it more prone to bleeding during sex.\n\n4. Endometriosis or Fibroids - Endometriosis or Fibroids can cause heavy or painful periods, which may result in bleeding after sex as well.\n\nIf the bleeding continues for an extended period or is accompanied by other symptoms such as pain, odor, or discharge, your wife should seek medical attention from a gynecologist.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hello, bleeding during sexual intercourse is mostly due to trauma to vagina or cervix by penis.

Fourth generation p24 anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) antibody is conclusive after a window of two to three weeks. So a negative result at 28 days is reliable.

HSV type 2 commonly causes genital herpes and HSV type 1 causes orolabial herpes. There is a risk that you may pass on the infection to your sexual partner. CMV (Cytomegalovirus) positivity is quite common in general population. It is a common viral infection and does not cause any issues in immune competent healthy individuals.

A HIV 1 and 2 with p24 antigen test after 28 days window period is highly sensitive and specific, and a non-reactive test result is considered conclusive.

Rubella, CMV, and HSV 1 and 2 IgG positive results indicate past exposure or infection to these viruses, but negative IgM results suggest that the infection is not active or recent.

TORCH IgG positive results do not necessarily need a treatment plan unless the infection is active or causes symptoms.

Additionally, make sure to inform your surgeon of your asthma diagnosis and any medications you are currently taking, as this information may impact your anesthesia and pain management plan.","answer_chatdoctor":"1. Yes, it is possible for a knee arthroscope to cause your posture issue.2. No, there is no direct link between scoliosis and pulmonary embolism.3.

For example, sitting, standing. Also, having scoliosis, would that cause a blood clot (pulmonary embolism) after this surgery? With being a severe asthmatic.\nOutput: Hello. Scoliosis is a structural problem and knee pain will not cause this. Arthroscopy can rarely lead to a clot formation but is not necessarily a known risk factor for DVT (deep vein thrombosis) as you are likely to mobilize very quickly and the procedure is usually short. Scoliosis does not add to the risks either. For more information consult an orthopaedician and traumatologist online <|endoftext|>"}

These tests are confirmatory in herpesvirus infection. These will tell your herpes status.

However, it's good news that you tested negative for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and HIV. The fact that you haven't experienced any symptoms of herpes in the four weeks since the incident is also a positive sign.\n\nIn terms of your wife's risk of contracting herpes, if you haven't experienced any symptoms, the risk is likely low. However, it's important to keep in mind that herpes can be spread through asymptomatic shedding of the virus. The best way to prevent transmission is to use barrier methods such as condoms consistently and correctly during sexual activity.\n\nIf your wife were to contract herpes during pregnancy, it could potentially pose a risk to the baby. However, most women with herpes have healthy pregnancies and give birth to healthy babies. It's important to discuss any concerns with your obstetrician, who can help guide you through the process of managing herpes during pregnancy.\n\nIn summary, while it's impossible to say for sure whether you have contracted herpes, the fact that you've tested negative for other STIs and haven't experienced any symptoms is encouraging.

I am almost three months post-op of having my ACL reconstructed along with a few lesions addressed during the surgery. I am concerned I have ruptured my ACL again after feeling a short sharp pain when turning in the sand on vacation. It has been three days since the incident and the knee now feels a lot looser and I have some pain in different areas. I have tried the Lachman test with no noticeable shifting, and the Lelli test was positive with good leverage hopefully assisted by my intact ACL. I will have to see my surgeon and physio soon but I am just wondering how accurate the Lelli test is. There seems to be no difference when comparing the test in both knees.\nOutput: Hello. I read through the concern. The Lelli test is accurate in diagnosing acute on chronic ACL tears, more sensitive than many other traditional tests performed in an acute condition, especially partial and acute tears. Do not be afraid. Keep calm. Take precautions not to strain and exert your knee. Keep it supported with an ACL brace until you get properly diagnosed by a good orthopedic or physio. Do not jump to a conclusion and keep worrying as you might not be accurate enough to say the reason for translation as there could be many factors like muscle inhibitions and imbalances that exist post surgery which may all confuse you leading to false positive tests. Hope this is helpful. Kindly revert back in case you need any further help in this regard. For more information consult a physiotherapist online  Take care.<|endoftext|>"}

The dryness is caused by the temporary disruption of the nerve supply to the cornea during the surgery which can take several weeks to recover. As a result, there is a decreased production of tears and a decrease in the quality of tears. This can lead to irritation, redness, and watering of your eyes.\n\nYou have already tried some of the lubricating eye drops that are commonly used to relieve dryness, but it seems like they are not working for you. There are other types of eye drops that your eye doctor can prescribe that may be more effective in relieving your symptoms. It is important to continue using the eye drops as prescribed by your eye doctor.\n\nIn addition to using eye drops, there are other measures that you can take to relieve your symptoms. These include:\n\n1. Avoiding environments with dry air, such as air conditioning or heating.\n\n2. Blinking frequently when using a computer or other screens for long periods of time.\n\n3. Using a humidifier at home or work to add moisture to the air.\n\n4. Drinking plenty of water to stay hydrated.\n\n5. Avoiding exposure to smoke, dust, and other irritants.\n\nIf your symptoms persist, it is important to follow up with your eye doctor. Your doctor may be able to recommend additional treatments or make changes to your medications to help relieve your symptoms.","answer_chatdoctor":"1) It could be due to excessive use of eye drops as you have mentioned that you were using them frequently after LASIK surgery.2) It may also be due to stress.3) You can try a lubricating ointment such as Tears Naturale or Refresh plus.4) You can also use artificial tears such as Restasis\/Lotemax\/Refresh plus etc.5) You should avoid too much exposure to sunlight.6) For external application, you can apply Refresh plus gel over your eyes.7) Do warm compresses over your closed eyes.

It is possible that your high level of stress could be contributing to these findings, although it is important to investigate other potential causes as well.\n\nGiven that your CBC shows normal levels of platelets, red blood cells, and hemoglobin, it is less likely that your low WBC count is due to a bone marrow disorder or other significant pathology. However, it is important to pursue further evaluation with your healthcare provider in order to determine the underlying cause of your low WBC count.\n\nIn some cases, medications or other medical conditions can lead to a low WBC count. Additionally, it is possible that your underlying anxiety or stress levels are contributing to your immune system functioning less optimally. Stress can cause a variety of physiological changes in the body, including a decrease in immune system function, which could be contributing to your lower WBC count.\n\nSince your CBC was drawn while you were menstruating, it is possible that this could contribute to some of the changes seen in your HCT and other blood parameters.

I would recommend seeing an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist for a thorough evaluation and diagnosis. They may perform a physical exam, hearing test, and possibly imaging studies to assess your condition. Treatment options may include antibiotics, decongestants, antihistamines, and\/or corticosteroids depending on the underlying cause.

But, due to neutralization of antigens by antibodies, as per theory, testing after 23 days up to 28 days may give false negatives (<0.001%).

And taking medico legality, no one gives you 100 % cure. No further test is needed. You are negative by 99.99 %. A change in result is unlikely. You will stay negative forever.

For more information consult an HIV AIDS specialist online ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello,\n\nIt is true that HIV has a window period where it may not show up in testing immediately after exposure. The current standard for testing is to get tested three months after exposure, as this will capture the vast majority of cases. However, there have been very rare instances where the window period extends beyond three months. While it is technically possible for it to take years for the virus to become detectable in a test, these rare cases are usually linked to specific factors - for example, people who are immunocompromised or take antiretroviral drugs may have a longer window period. However, these cases are extremely rare and do not represent the typical course of HIV infection.\n\nIn general, if you have a negative test result at six months post-exposure, it is considered conclusive. This is because the overwhelming majority of people will show positive on a test within this timeframe. However, it's always important to get tested regularly if you engage in risky sexual behavior or have other concerns about your HIV status.\n\nDifferent tests have different levels of reliability, but in general, modern tests are very accurate. False negatives may occur if the test is taken too early in the window period or in rare cases with certain types of HIV. However, the possibility of a false negative is extremely low.\n\nGiven that you have had negative HIV RNA PCR qualitative and HIV-Alere combo tests at 15 and 20 months post-exposure, it is highly unlikely that you have HIV. These tests are very sensitive and generally accurate. It's always possible to get retested in the future, but for now, it's safe to assume that you do not have HIV.\n\nIn short, while there is always a small possibility of a false negative, six months is generally considered to be a conclusive window period for HIV testing.

People say that it may take years to develop symptoms of HIV but this is not entirely correct. It may take years before the virus starts replicating at high levels and causes symptoms.3. The Alere Combo test is a combination of HIV antigen and p24 antigens. The HIV antigen is detected earliest and the p24 antigen is detected later. Both tests are combined to get an early detection.4.

These fatty acids have antimicrobial properties which help to protect the skin against harmful microns. Coconut oil also has anti-inflammatory properties. It helps to protect the skin from inflammation, contact dermatitis, eczema or other inflammatory conditions. It also helps to nourish and moisturize the skin. Coconut oil does not contain protein or carbohy","answer_chatgpt":"Hello! Coconut oil has been a controversial topic in the skincare community, and I'm happy to share some insight with you.\n\nPros: \n- Coconut oil is a natural moisturizer that can help soothe and hydrate dry skin.\n- It also contains anti-inflammatory properties that can help calm irritated skin.\n- Coconut oil is rich in antioxidants that can help protect the skin from environmental damage.\n- It can also improve skin\u2019s elasticity and smoothness over time.\n\nCons:\n- Coconut oil can be comedogenic (pore-clogging) for some people, which can lead to breakouts.\n- It is possible to be allergic to coconut oil, which can cause skin irritation or a rash.\n- Coconut oil can also interfere with some topical acne treatments by forming a barrier on the skin and preventing the medication from working effectively.\n\nSkin types that can benefit most from coconut oil are those that are dry, dehydrated, or suffer from skin conditions such as eczema or psoriasis. However, those with oily or acne-prone skin should steer clear and use caution when incorporating coconut oil into their routine.\n\nIf someone wants to use coconut oil on their face, I recommend using organic, unrefined virgin coconut oil. This ensures that the oil is pure and has not been processed with chemicals that may irritate the skin.\n\nTo use coconut oil in your routine without causing breakouts, it is best to use it as a spot treatment for dry areas or mixed with other non-comedogenic ingredients to dilute its potentially pore-clogging effects. You can also use it as a gentle eye makeup remover or as a hair mask before shampooing.\n\nOverall, while coconut oil may have benefits for some people's skin, others may not react well to it. As with any new product, it's important to patch test first and pay attention to how your skin reacts. If you're unsure, speak with your dermatologist to determine whether it's a safe option for your skin type.","answer_chatdoctor":"1.

{"input":"Hello doctor,I noticed a small triangular bald spot in my beard three weeks ago. It was likely alopecia areata. Saw my dermatologist last week, she said it was likely folliculitis. I have had folliculitis before in the same area and it was much different. She is the doctor. So I accepted and moved on. One small spot that has some hair growing back, small thin white hair. Yesterday, I noticed what appeared to be a bald spot in my pubic hair above the penis. When I trimmed the hair back, it revealed a quarter sized bald spot and a smaller dime sized spot. I am not sure how long they may have been there as they were somewhat masked by a longer pubic hair. So, now I have what I believe to be three spots, two below abdomen and one on beard. My concern is more of them spreading than the current spots.I am now thinking back about the annual checkup that I had with my GP six months back.

Maintain good oral hygiene regularly, but for sure get it treated. Avoid eating from the affected side until it gets treated or even if you eat make sure nothing gets lodged in that tooth. Do mouth rinses with plain water regularly so that there is no food stuck.  ChatDoctor.  I hope this helps. <|endoftext|>"}

So I went to a urologist and I had my testicles tested because I had pain there and thought it was the reason for all this.

","answer_chatgpt":"Hello, it's good that you are seeking information about your condition and asking questions about the proposed treatment plan. Retrograde ejaculation can be caused by several factors, including nerve damage, medications, or surgery. The fact that you have also experienced male incontinence and urinary retention could suggest a problem with your bladder or prostate.\n\nBefore undergoing any surgical procedure, it's important to have a clear understanding of why it's being recommended and what the possible risks and benefits are. TURP is typically used to treat an enlarged prostate that is causing urinary symptoms, but it may not be necessary in your case.\n\nIf your urologist doesn't seem receptive to your concerns, you might consider seeking a second opinion from another urologist who is willing to explore all possible causes of your symptoms and recommend appropriate treatment options. Testing for multiple sclerosis or nerve damage, as well as evaluating your bladder function, may be important steps in determining the underlying cause of your symptoms.\n\nIt's also important to note that some degree of pain or discomfort following TURP is common, but your doctor should be able to manage your symptoms appropriately. However, if you have concerns about the procedure, you should discuss them with your doctor and explore other treatment options if appropriate.\n\nOverall, I would encourage you to continue advocating for your health and seeking out medical professionals who are willing to listen to your concerns and help you find answers.","answer_chatdoctor":"1. Retrograde ejaculation is due to failure of the seminal vesicle which stores the secretion produced by the prostate gland and other accessory organs of the genitourinary system. It is caused by either damage to the sphincter mechanism of the urethra or by obstruction of the urethra itself. The treatment depends upon the cause of retrograde ejaculation. 2. You have to get your blood sugar levels checked as you may have diabetes. If you don't have diabetes, then you can consult a neurologist who would examine you physically and would refer you to a urologist if required.","text":"Instruct: Hello doctor,I am pretty sure that I have retrograde ejaculation because when I ejaculate it does not come out at the same moment of ejaculation, but it does come out seconds later and when I urinate there is some sperm.

The cylindrical correction (the -1.25 DC \u00d7 95 and -0.25\/-0.75 \u00d7 75) helps to correct this astigmatism, enabling you to see more clearly.\n\nHaving a cylindrical correction doesn't mean that your eyes are weak; it's just a different type of refractive error. There is no other way to correct for astigmatism other than using a cylindrical correction in either glasses or contact lenses.

I would like to know whether my eye power is too weak. Is there any other way available to correct cylindrical power?\nOutput: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. The cylinder power is low, and there is nothing to worry. As there is astigmatism, the glasses have to be worn at all times. You do not need to wear glasses if you do not have symptoms like eyestrain or a headache. But if you have eyestrain and headache, you need to wear glasses. The power is low, so surgical treatment is not necessary. Contact lenses work very well, but for astigmatism, there will be mild discomfort in contact lens users.

I can go even more than 30 times a day - majority of these times, I feel an increased urgency. However, when I go, only a small amount or drops come out. For the past two to three days, the urgency kind of feels to be getting worse, I feel as if I will not be able to hold it. However, I am still able to as there is no leaking. There is no burning or irritation or any discharge. No recent sexual encounters and no other associated symptoms. I take Coveram 10\/10 for essential hypertension and Valdoxan 25 because I also do suffer from anxiety. I have been under stress lately as I was doing my exams this past week and finished today. I have done a few tests at my family doctor: Last week I did a dipstick which was normal apart from +1 protein. Voiding bladder US was normal (450 mL pre voiding, 45 mL post voiding). An initial urine culture was normal according to my doctor. Yesterday, I performed another dipstick and urine culture. The dipstick was normal, and early urine microscopy showed 10 to 100 white cell count. We are waiting for the cultures to return. Due to the result of the white cell count, my doctor said it would be worth a try to undergo a 5-day course of antibiotics (Keflex).Today is my third day of antibiotic treatment, symptoms are largely the same.

If you have been regular with your menses these years and this is the first episode at 53 years of age when the menses have been delayed by two weeks, the causes can be a possible initiation of perimenopausal stage where menses are often delayed for a month or two and slowly tend to stop in next one to two years. Perimenopausal stage can be verified with the hormonal FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (Luteinizing hormone) levels which if high shall indicate an onset of perimenopausal stage. However, it is suggested that pregnancy should anyways be ruled out and if negative then you can wait naturally for your menses to resume. Hence, try maintaining a menstrual calendar and keep a mark for your dates, duration of flow and quantity to evaluate the possible onset of a perimenopausal state. <|endoftext|>"}

In terms of blood types, it is generally safe for individuals with the same blood group to marry, as there is no risk of blood type incompatibility during pregnancy. However, in the case of close relatives, there may be a higher risk of inherited genetic disorders.\n\nWhen closely related individuals have children, they are more likely to share the same genes, which can increase the likelihood of genetic disorders being passed down to their offspring. This is because close relatives share more genetic material than unrelated individuals do, creating a reduced genetic pool.\n\nWith regard to your specific situation, it is important to note that marrying a first cousin (which is what a maternal uncle's daughter is) carries an increased risk of passing down genetic disorders to offspring. However, the degree of risk varies depending on a number of factors, including the specific genetic disorders that may be present in your family, as well as any other factors that may affect your individual health status.\n\nIf you are considering marrying your cousin, it is recommended that you consult with a genetic counselor or a healthcare professional with experience in genetic testing and counseling. They can help you understand the specific risks associated with your situation, and can recommend any genetic tests that may be necessary to ensure the health of your future children.\n\nIn summary, while it is generally safe for individuals with the same blood group to marry, marrying a close relative carries an increased risk of passing down genetic disorders to offspring.

I will be happy to guide you regarding the exercises that can help her.\n\nThe waist joint pain could be due to various reasons, including osteoarthritis, herniated disc, or muscle spasm. Therefore, the specific exercises that will benefit her depend on the underlying cause of the pain.\n\nAs your orthopedic doctor suggested, spinal exercises can help improve the flexibility and strength of the spine and providing relief from pain. These exercises can be done at home with minimal equipment.\n\nHere are some exercises that can help your mother:\n\n1. Cat-Cow Stretch: This exercise involves moving the spine from a rounded position (cat) to an arched position (cow). It helps improve spinal mobility and flexibility.\n\n2. Seated Spinal Twist: This exercise involves twisting the spine while seated, which helps improve spinal mobility and reduces stiffness.\n\n3. Pelvic Tilts: This exercise involves tilting the pelvis backward and forward, which helps strengthen the lower back muscles.\n\n4. Bird Dog: This exercise involves extending the opposite arm and leg, which helps improve spine stability and muscle strength.\n\n5. Hip Bridges: This exercise involves lifting your hips off the ground while lying on your back, which helps strengthen the buttock and lower-back muscles.\n\nIt is important to note that your mother should start slowly and gradually progress to more challenging exercises to avoid any discomfort or injury.\n\nHere are some video links that you can refer to for guidance:\n\n1. Cat-Cow Stretch: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bXzW9tYKGqc\n\n2. Seated Spinal Twists: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=N0TAbBEzvq8\n\n3.

It's great that you've started making changes to your diet and exercise routine \u2013 these are important steps for managing blood sugar and overall health.\n\nFirst, let me reassure you that insulin itself does not cause weight gain. However, when insulin is used to manage blood sugar levels, it can lead to increased appetite and storage of body fat if blood sugar levels are not managed properly. It's important to make sure your insulin regimen is appropriate for your current weight and activity level, and that your blood sugar levels are well-controlled through regular monitoring and adjustments to your insulin dose as needed.\n\nResistance training is a great way to build lean muscle mass, increase metabolism, and improve insulin sensitivity. However, it can take time to see changes in body composition \u2013 especially in specific areas like the upper body. Keep up with your exercise routine and be patient with the process.\n\nIn terms of your diet, it's important to focus on nutrient-dense foods that will support your overall health and blood sugar management. This means plenty of vegetables, lean proteins, healthy fats, and complex carbohydrates. Avoid highly processed foods, sugary drinks, and excessive snacking.\n\nIf you're still feeling concerned, it may be helpful to schedule a telehealth appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your insulin regimen and any other concerns you may have. They can help you make any necessary adjustments to your medications, monitor your blood sugar levels, and provide guidance on diet and exercise.\n\nOverall, it's important to remember that managing type 1 diabetes is a lifelong process that requires patience, persistence, and ongoing support from healthcare providers and loved ones.

First of all, it's important to know that the height of a child is largely determined by genetics, so your daughter's current height might be influenced by both you and your wife's heights.

It's best to discuss this with her pediatrician and ask if her current medication can affect her growth. \n\nAdenoids, on the other hand, are typically not related to height, but if they are causing difficulty breathing or snoring at night, it's important to address this as it can affect her quality of sleep, which may indirectly affect her growth. Homeopathic treatments may help alleviate the symptoms, but it's best to monitor her progress and consult with her pediatrician regularly. \n\nAs for what you can do to promote her growth, ensuring that she has a well-balanced and nutrient-rich diet is essential. It's good that she takes Pediasure and gets protein from eggs, but she should also have a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Regular exercise, such as swimming, is also great. \n\nIn terms of her predicted height, there are several ways to estimate a child's height, but it's important to note that these predictions may not be accurate.

You should check your blood glucose again between 45 minutes and 90 minutes after eating something containing carbohydrates. It will be higher than the fasting level. This rise in blood glucose is due to the action of insulin which your body produces to digest the food. After that it should come down again to the fasting level within two hours. This is called the peak response or the area under curve (AUC). The AUC value can help to know how well your body is responding to the insulin produced by the pancreas.

It is important to understand the type of bleeding that occurred during your stroke in order to determine its severity and potential for long-term damage.\n\nThe two types of bleeding that can occur during a stroke are intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).\n\nICH occurs when blood vessels within the brain rupture and blood leaks into the surrounding brain tissue. This type of bleeding is typically considered more dangerous because it can lead to significant damage to the surrounding brain tissue and can be life-threatening.\n\nSAH occurs when blood vessels in the brain\u2019s surface or within the subarachnoid space (the area between the brain and the tissues that cover it) rupture and blood leaks into this space. While SAH can also be serious and may require surgery, it is generally considered less severe than ICH.\n\nThe reason why ICH is considered more dangerous is due to the amount of blood and pressure that builds up within the brain from the bleeding. This can cause significant damage to the brain tissue and increase the risk of complications such as seizures, brain swelling, and coma.\n\nIt is important to seek medical attention immediately if you suspect you have had a stroke, so that the type and severity of the stroke can be determined and appropriate treatment can begin quickly.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi thanks for contacting Chat Doctor...

It's difficult to say for sure what may be causing your symptoms without a more thorough examination, but there are a few possibilities that could be causing the pain or discomfort when you yawn.\n\nOne possibility is that you could be experiencing jaw muscle strain or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction. When you yawn, there is an increased demand on the muscles and joints in your jaw, which could cause some pain or discomfort. Similarly, if you are clenching your jaw during the day or grinding your teeth at night, this could also contribute to muscle strain or TMJ problems.\n\nAnother possibility is that you could have a dental issue, such as a cavity or an infection in the root of one of your teeth. These types of issues can also cause pain or discomfort in the jaw area.\n\nI would recommend seeing a dentist or doctor to assess your symptoms and provide a proper diagnosis. They may recommend some imaging tests or refer you to a specialist like a dentist who focuses on TMJ issues. Depending on the cause of your symptoms, they may recommend treatments such as physical therapy, pain management techniques, or dental repairs.\n\nIn the meantime, you may try to avoid excessive jaw movement and clenching, and apply heat or ice to the affected area to alleviate any pain or discomfort.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum.

Thirdly, you ejaculated over her butt and before the sperm could trickle to her vagina, you wiped it off. In this case as well, chances of pregnancy are minimal and do not qualify for any need for an emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of sex. As there was no unprotected intercourse involved, so you can be sure that there are no chances of pregnancy in this situation. <|endoftext|>"}

Based on your mother's medical history and symptoms, it seems that she has multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease - hypertension, diabetes, mild nephropathy, and hyperlipidemia. The presence of chest pain could be due to chronic stable angina, which is a type of heart disease caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.\n\nSince your family doctor has suggested angiography, it means that they suspect a possible blockage in the coronary arteries. Angiography is an invasive test that involves injecting a contrast dye into the arteries and taking X-rays to visualize the blood vessels. It can help determine the location and extent of any blockages.\n\nHowever, before proceeding with angiography, your mother's kidney function needs to be thoroughly assessed. With a creatinine level of 1.3, she is already at the lower limit of normal kidney function, and contrast dye can further impair it.

{"input":"Hi doctor,I do a couple of sports to have some hip flexibility. I am pretty flexible, and I can do right and left splits. But when doing the center split, I get a stopping pain in my outer hip with no stretch in my inner thigh. If I rotate my knees back and hips forward, I can do more stretch, but there is also a slight stop. What is this and can it be worked? Will stretching help to release that stopping pain or am I anatomically incapable of doing a middle split? There is pain only when I am doing a center split. How to fix it? I do a lot of kicking, and I do not want to injure myself.","answer_icliniq":"Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. There are many factors, other than tight inner thigh muscles that limit the split especially center split. Bony restriction in the hip joint, as the hip joint bone gets jammed into socket because of extreme coxa vara angle (angulation between the neck and shaft of the thigh bone) leading to restrictions in movement. These jams will not happen when you do a side split as there is slight rotation occurring in the joint and allows the action to happen.  Other reason could be ligamentous (pubofemoral ligament) limitation as the ligament tightens and it limits the further movement. This ligament realigns and will relax while doing forward and side split. So, it will not restrict your movement other than center split. You can try tilting your pelvis forward so that there can be some relief with limitation in both the cases. For more information consult a physiotherapist online ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello! It sounds like you may be experiencing some hip impingement when attempting the center split. Hip impingement occurs when the bones of the hip joint rub against each other, causing pain and limited range of motion.\n\nThere are a few things you can try to address this issue:\n\n1. Stretch regularly, but gently. Focus on stretching the adductor muscles in your inner thigh and the external rotators of your hip. Avoid forcing yourself into positions that cause pain.\n\n2. Strengthen the muscles around your hip joint. Strengthening exercises, such as clamshells and hip bridges, can help to support the joint and prevent impingement.\n\n3. Adjust your technique when doing the center split. Instead of spreading your legs as wide as possible, try to keep your knees bent and your hips rotated forward. This will help to avoid the impingement and allow for a deeper stretch.\n\n4. Consider consulting a physical therapist. A physical therapist can help you to identify any imbalances or weaknesses in your hip muscles and work with you to develop a personalized plan to address the issue.\n\nIt's important to listen to your body and avoid pushing too hard too fast. With patience and persistence, you can work to improve your center split while avoiding injury.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, Thanks for writing in. The center split you are referring to is called as the \"splitting\" of the leg. This is done by rotating the foot inwards while keeping the knee straight. When you do this, your whole body weight gets transferred to the front side of the knee. This is where the pain originates from. When you rotate the knee backwards and hips forward, the pressure is shifted to the other side and hence the pain reduces. It is possible to reduce the pain through stretching exercises. You should start with gentle stretching of the groin muscles and then gradually move onto full splits. However, if the pain persists even after adequate stretching, you may need to consult a physician who will advise you further investigations like X-ray, MRI etc. In case it is a ligament injury, physical therapy along with medicines will help.","text":"Instruct: Hi doctor,I do a couple of sports to have some hip flexibility. I am pretty flexible, and I can do right and left splits. But when doing the center split, I get a stopping pain in my outer hip with no stretch in my inner thigh. If I rotate my knees back and hips forward, I can do more stretch, but there is also a slight stop. What is this and can it be worked? Will stretching help to release that stopping pain or am I anatomically incapable of doing a middle split? There is pain only when I am doing a center split. How to fix it? I do a lot of kicking, and I do not want to injure myself.\nOutput: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. There are many factors, other than tight inner thigh muscles that limit the split especially center split. Bony restriction in the hip joint, as the hip joint bone gets jammed into socket because of extreme coxa vara angle (angulation between the neck and shaft of the thigh bone) leading to restrictions in movement. These jams will not happen when you do a side split as there is slight rotation occurring in the joint and allows the action to happen.  Other reason could be ligamentous (pubofemoral ligament) limitation as the ligament tightens and it limits the further movement. This ligament realigns and will relax while doing forward and side split. So, it will not restrict your movement other than center split. You can try tilting your pelvis forward so that there can be some relief with limitation in both the cases. For more information consult a physiotherapist online <|endoftext|>"}

However, the identification of two soft markers during your anomaly scan does increase the risk slightly.\n\nIt's good that you have given blood for NIPT (Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing), as this test has a high accuracy rate for detecting Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities. However, it can take some time to receive the results from this test, so it's understandable that you may be feeling anxious and stressed.\n\nIn terms of the specific markers identified during your scan, CP cyst and mild RPD, both of these markers are relatively common and are often benign. CP cysts are fluid-filled spaces that can be detected in the brain of the developing fetus. They are usually benign and resolve on their own without causing any problems. Likewise, mild RPD is a common ultrasound finding that usually resolves on its own without causing any problems.\n\nOverall, it's important to remember that soft markers are just that - markers. They do not definitively indicate an abnormality and may resolve on their own. The NIPT test should provide you with more information, but even if it does come back positive for a chromosomal abnormality, it's important to remember that many of these conditions can be managed and that there is support available.\n\nIn the meantime, it's important to try and manage your stress levels as best you can. Make sure to seek support from loved ones, and consider speaking with a counselor or therapist if you feel you need additional support.\n\nBest of luck to you.","answer_chatdoctor":"1) You should wait for the result of your NIPT tests.2) The detection rate of NT and double marker is approximately 85%.3) In case of positive result, you can go for invasive testing like chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis.4) In my opinion, it would be better if you consult with a geneticist\/obstetrician for further management.

Firstly, we need to be sure if your pain is really Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) as there can be other causes of facial pain like idiopathic facial pain, Post-herpetic neuralgia.

","answer_chatgpt":"Firstly, it's important to note that only a qualified doctor who has examined you and is familiar with your medical history can give you specific advice on your medication. With that being said, here are some general points to consider:\n\n1. It is common for doctors to monitor serum levels of Lamictal when another medication is added or changed due to potential interactions. This can help ensure that the Lamictal remains at a therapeutic level.\n\n2. Carbamazepine is considered a first-line treatment for trigeminal neuralgia, and is a medication many patients with this condition find helpful. However, it's not a one-size-fits-all solution, and some patients may not have success with it.\n\n3. Oxcarbazepine is structurally similar to carbamazepine and is sometimes used as a substitute for patients who cannot tolerate carbamazepine or have had a poor response to it. It does not appear to have significant interactions with Lamictal, but again, this would be something for your doctor to consider and monitor.\n\n4. Injections for pain can be effective for some patients, but it's important to discuss the potential risks and benefits with your doctor, as well as whether this is a feasible option for you.\n\n5. Namenda is an Alzheimer's medication that has been used off-label for pain management, particularly chronic pain that is not responding to other treatments. This medication is not typically used for trigeminal neuralgia, but it's possible your old neurologist had a particular reason for suggesting it.\n\nIn summary, there are various options to consider for managing your pain, including medications like carbamazepine or oxcarbazepine, as well as injections or off-label use of certain medications. It's important to work closely with a doctor who can help you determine the best course of action based on your specific needs and medical history.","answer_chatdoctor":"1) Trigeminal neuralgia can be treated with Gabapentin, pregabalin and carbamazepine.2) Trigeminal neuralgia can be managed by medication (antiepileptic Chat Doctor. 3) If not responding to medicine, surgical management with Gamma Knife can be done.4) For the Migraine pain, you can switch over to other medications like Topiramate, propranolol, methysergide, etc. Hope this answers your question.

Could you please look into this and help us?In all these spots, we applied Corticosteroid last year for eczema (hand, neck, chest and back) at the same spots where the white patches started and then grown big now. The only spot where we have not applied Corticosteroid but observed white patch is on the eye. We started seeing a white patch on the right eye as well from the last three weeks.\nOutput: Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. I have gone through your history and clinical photographs (attachment removed to protect patient identity). From the present situation, it looks to be vitiligo. Since it is on one side of the body, it can be called as segmental vitiligo also. Tacrolimus is the right medication. Wood\\s lamp examination helps to diagnose vitiligo. Yes, in some places, there is repigmentation which is a good sign. Did anyone in the family have vitiligo? Revert with more information to a cosmetologist online <|endoftext|>"}

Can it be responsible for mood fluctuations, depression and\/or panic attacks?There are no clear symptoms, but only mild depression (also had recent changes in life and my father died) and anxiety. No strong pain, only a minor one when my heart pounds fast. But I have to pay attention in order to feel it, it is very subtle. I am currently taking mild anti-stress natural medication and a quarter tablet of Betaloc-ZOK 50 mg in the evening to lower my pulse.

Having said that its size does affect the lobe functions if it is compressing it. So basically if you have symptoms that are not responding to the medical line of treatment then only you should opt for a surgical option. ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello there! I understand your concern regarding arachnoid cyst and its possible impact on your mood and anxiety. Arachnoid cysts are fluid-filled sacs that develop between the brain and the arachnoid membrane, one of the three protective layers that cover the brain. The majority of these cysts are asymptomatic, which means that they do not produce any symptoms.\n\nHowever, in some cases, an arachnoid cyst may cause symptoms, such as headaches, seizures, vertigo, dizziness, or balance problems. In rare cases, the cyst may compress nearby structures, leading to neurological deficits.\n\nRegarding your concern about mood fluctuations, depression, and panic attacks, there is some evidence suggesting that arachnoid cysts may be associated with psychiatric symptoms. Some studies have reported an increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, in individuals with arachnoid cysts.\n\nHowever, it is not clear whether the cyst is directly responsible for these symptoms or whether they are secondary to other factors, such as life events, genetic factors, or medication side effects.\n\nIn your case, it is unlikely that your mild depression and anxiety are directly related to the arachnoid cyst. Given your recent life changes and the loss of your father, these symptoms are more likely to be secondary to external factors.\n\nMoreover, the mild chest discomfort that you describe is more likely related to anxiety rather than any cardiac problems, given that you are taking Betaloc-ZOK, which is a medication used to lower blood pressure and heart rate. It is important to continue taking this medication as prescribed by your doctor.\n\nIn summary, while an arachnoid cyst can sometimes cause symptoms, your mild depression and anxiety are more likely related to external factors. It is essential to continue taking your medication and to seek professional help if your symptoms persist or worsen.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. As you describe your problem, you seem to have a benign tumor called Galassi Arachnoid Cyst. This is not a serious condition and can be treated without any surgery.

I have noted your concern and I have viewed the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It looks to be a pretty benign nevus to me. Well defined, uniform colored, small, rough to oval, and symmetrical. I think the nevus perhaps has an ingrown hair and the resulting inflammation has caused it to swell up and sting a little. I suggest you apply a topical antibiotic either Neosporin ointment or Mupirocin 2 % ointment, twice daily for a few days. Regards. For more information consult a dermatologist online <|endoftext|>"}

For more information consult a hematologist online ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello,\n\nIron is an essential mineral that is important for the production of red blood cells, and low levels of iron in the body can lead to anemia. Anemia can cause symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. However, low iron levels in the absence of anemia can also cause fatigue, as iron plays a critical role in the production of energy in the body.\n\nIron is an essential component of hemoglobin, which is the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen to tissues throughout the body. Iron is also involved in the production of ATP, which is the primary source of energy in cells. When iron levels are low, the production of ATP is reduced, and this can lead to fatigue.\n\nBased on your blood work, it appears that your iron levels are improving with supplementation. However, it is important to note that iron supplementation can have side effects, including gastrointestinal upset, constipation, and nausea. In rare cases, iron supplementation can lead to iron toxicity, which can cause symptoms like abdominal pain, vomiting, and liver damage.\n\nTo monitor for iron toxicity, it is important to have regular blood work done while taking iron supplements. This will help to ensure that iron levels are not too high and that the supplementation is not causing any harm. In general, it is recommended to have blood work done every 3-6 months while taking iron supplements.\n\nRegarding the duration and dosage of iron supplementation, it is best to follow the advice of your healthcare provider. Depending on your individual situation, they may recommend continuing iron supplementation until your ferritin levels are in the normal range, or they may suggest discontinuing supplementation and rechecking levels in a few months.\n\nI hope this information is helpful to you.

You are quite aware of the condition and have managed to live with the issue, but as you say, you cannot walk not than a mile, but it does not seem to be your main issue. If you required to walk longer, then laminectomy will be the solution, but you need to get relief from back pain. I will hazard a guess that this is from local instability, faceted, or discal. I will say that because that is usually the reason for back pain in patients with disc issues. Lumbar canal stenosis will not often give rise to back pain. I will recommend that you discuss this with your doctor and perhaps go for laminectomy and pedicle screw stabilization as this will help relieve both issues. <|endoftext|>"}

I understand that you have some concerns regarding potential exposure to HIV during sexual activity and the accuracy of subsequent testing.\n\n1. It is theoretically possible for vaginal fluids to enter an exposed penis during sexual activity, even if lotion is being used. However, the risk of HIV transmission in this scenario is quite low, especially if the condom was worn for most of the sexual encounter. Assuming that your partner's status was unknown, I would recommend getting tested for HIV as a precaution if you have not already done so.\n\n2. The current recommendation is to get tested for HIV at 4-6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months after a potential exposure. While a negative p24 test at four weeks is reassuring, it is not considered conclusive. I would recommend getting retested at the 3 month mark to confirm your status.\n\n3. It is not uncommon to experience swollen lymph nodes in the neck area, and this can be caused by a variety of factors. HIV infection is one possible cause, but there are many other potential explanations. If you are concerned about your symptoms, it would be advisable to speak with a healthcare provider who can evaluate you and provide guidance on next steps.\n\nI hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reach out if you have any additional questions or concerns.","answer_chatdoctor":"1. No, it does not mean that you are infected if you didn't have sexual intercourse. You should get tested for HIV after 6 months.2. The result of test at 4-week may be false negative. But it is very unlikely to turn from negative to positive within 8 weeks.3. It can be a viral infection. Swelling of the lymph nodes might indicate infection. So you need to do blood work up.","text":"Instruct: Hello doctor,I had protected sex before two years.

While they can be effective, they may not be as fast-acting as intravenous iron and may cause gastrointestinal side effects such as constipation, diarrhea, or nausea. If you choose to try oral supplements, it may be helpful to start with a lower dose and gradually increase the dose over time while monitoring for side effects. \n\nAnother option is intramuscular injections of iron, which may be less likely to cause adverse effects compared to intravenous administration. This can be discussed with your doctor to determine if it may be suitable for you. \n\nThere are also newer formulations of intravenous iron that are designed to minimize adverse effects, such as low molecular weight iron dextran or ferric carboxymaltose.

First of let me tell you that if your menses is coming every month with 2-3 days here or there then it is absolutely normal cycle. Now in normal cycle ovulation occurs in the middle of the cycle (around 12-18th day of cycle) when conception can actually happen. First 8 and last 8 days of your cycle are safe period in normal menses as there is no chance of pregnancy thus safe.  Now pregnancy can happen in regular and irregular cycle both.

General anesthesia (GA) and regional anesthesia (RA) are used, and Local anesthesia (LA) is rarely used in obstetrics.\n\n4. Yes, some anesthetic agents can cross the placenta and affect the baby.\n\n5. The type of anesthetic and the dosage administered to the mother are critical factors in deciding if the baby might be affected. The anesthesiologist can reduce the risk of adverse effects by using an appropriate anesthetic and monitoring the mother and the baby.\n\n6. The frequency of administering anesthesia to infants depends on the hospital and the number of surgical procedures performed. It varies widely between hospitals.\n\n7. The type of anesthetic used for pediatric surgeries depends on the age of the child, the type of surgical procedure, and other factors. Both GA and RA are used in pediatric surgeries.\n\n8. Various chemicals compounds are used as anesthetics, such as propofol, sevoflurane, and desflurane.\n\n9. The use of an anesthetic cocktail involves mixing two or more drugs to achieve a specific effect. The use of cocktails depends on the surgery and the patient's health condition.\n\n10. There is some evidence that exposure to anesthesia during early childhood might have negative long-term effects on a child's neurodevelopment. Anesthesiologists strive to minimize the risk by using appropriate anesthetics and by monitoring the patient's condition.\n\n11. Anesthesiologists usually explain the procedure, the type of anesthesia used, and the possible side effects to the patient before administering the anesthesia.\n\n12. Some anesthesiologists follow up with their pediatric patients after surgery to monitor their recovery and check for any long-term effects. However, this depends on the hospital policy and the preference of the anesthesiologist.\n\n13. Anesthesiology is a vast field that involves various types of anesthesia, surgery, and patient demographics. Some research has shown promising results in reducing the risk of adverse effects of anesthesia.","answer_chatdoctor":"1. How many years have you been a part of this profession? 2.

","answer_chatgpt":"Hi there, the test result you mentioned indicates that your sister has a male karyotype (46,XY) instead of a female karyotype (46,XX) which is the usual karyotype for females. This suggests that your sister may have a condition called Swyer syndrome or XY gonadal dysgenesis. Swyer syndrome is a rare genetic condition that leads to underdeveloped or absent ovaries in individuals with a female appearance. \n\nIn Swyer syndrome, individuals typically have female external genitalia, but the ovaries are either absent or not functioning properly. This leads to a lack of estrogen production and the absence of menstruation. Individuals with Swyer syndrome are usually infertile, as they do not ovulate.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, your sister may need to have a complete evaluation by an endocrinologist and a genetic counselor. Tests may include hormone levels, pelvic ultrasound, MRI, and genetic testing to assess the underlying cause of the condition.\n\nIn terms of treatment, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can be used to replace the missing estrogen and induce menstrual periods. However, this does not restore fertility. To have biological children, your sister may need to consider assisted reproductive technologies, such as IVF with donor eggs or surrogacy.\n\nIt is important to note that individuals with Swyer syndrome have a slightly increased risk of developing certain types of cancer, such as gonadal tumors. Therefore, regular surveillance and monitoring are recommended.\n\nI would highly recommend speaking with a healthcare provider who specializes in endocrinology and genetics to discuss further evaluation and management options for your sister.","answer_chatdoctor":"46XY means that your sister is a male.

I have been jumping from one idea to another for a long time but it has been three years I have an issue with frequent urination. It started in a bad time for me when I was obsessing that I have HIV. No burning, just slight urethra burning. I went to a urologist. He told me nothing was wrong, maybe an overactive bladder. I go to the toilet every two hours or three. I never knew what was wrong, but I started to obsess over it and it got worse to a place that my mind is in urination 24\/7. I almost gave up until I went on a vacation and during that vacation, I forgot about it totally. The frequency was gone and even the burning urethra.

The statement is based on the following facts: I hope this answers you. For more information consult an an ChatDoctor. ChatDoctor\/ask-a-doctor-online\/an","answer_chatgpt":"Hello,\n\nYes, anxiety can cause polyuria (frequent urination) due to the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. When you are anxious, your body releases stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which can increase urine production and cause you to feel the need to urinate more frequently.\n\nIt is also possible that your anxiety is causing you to hyper-focus on your urinary habits, making it seem more significant than it is. The fact that you noticed improvement in your symptoms during periods of distraction supports this theory.\n\nIf your urologist has ruled out any medical causes for your symptoms, it may be beneficial for you to seek treatment for your anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can be particularly helpful for anxiety-related bladder issues, as it can help you to reframe negative thoughts and learn coping strategies to manage your symptoms.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you all the best.","answer_chatdoctor":"1) Anxiety can be associated with polyuria. Polyuria is excessive urination more than 2 liters per day. So if your urine volume is less than 2 liters per day then there is no need to worry about polyuria. You should see a psychiatrist as soon as possible.2) You may be having Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). This is a type of anxiety disorder. OCD patients keep on repeating certain thoughts and behaviors which they think will relieve their anxiety. But these thoughts and behavior are actually making the situation worse. So OCD patients need to learn how to control their thoughts and behaviors. A good psychologist can help you in this regard.","text":"Instruct: Hello doctor,I am a 34 year old male.

A 2-cm kidney stone is a fairly large one and it will definitely require surgery. I cannot recommend using any natural remedies for a stone of this size though they will not affect the stent. The stone, however, can move to cause obstruction again, but this is unlikely if the stent remains in position. The surgery has to be done under general anesthesia. The procedure used varies based on the location of the stone and your treating urologist. I would have to have a look at the CT (computed tomography) scan images before I can make a plan. I would recommend you to go ahead with the surgery as that gives you the best chance of getting your stone removed. For more information consult a urologist online ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello! It sounds like you are dealing with a difficult situation. I can provide some general information that may be helpful, but please keep in mind that I cannot provide specific medical advice without examining you and reviewing your medical history and test results.\n\nRegarding your concern about using natural remedies, it is always important to be cautious and consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new treatment. Some natural remedies, such as certain herbs or substances, may interact with your current medications or have other side effects.\n\nIn terms of anesthesia for a procedure such as stent placement or removal, the choice of anesthesia depends on several factors, including the patient's preferences and medical history, the type of procedure, and the surgeon's recommendation. Local anesthesia, which numbs only a specific area of the body, may be used for stent placement or removal in some cases. However, this decision would ultimately be up to your surgeon.\n\nRegarding your question about whether kidney stones can come out from behind, it is possible for stones to move within the urinary tract and cause a blockage, which can lead to complications such as infection or kidney damage. However, it is important to remember that each case is unique, and the likelihood of a stone being able to move or pass depends on several factors, including the size and location of the stone, the size of the ureter (the tube that connects the kidney to the bladder), and the patient's overall health.\n\nRegarding your diabetes, it is important to continue taking your medications as prescribed and to work with your healthcare provider to manage your blood sugar levels. Some natural remedies, such as consuming lemon juice or olive oil, have been suggested as possible treatments for kidney stones, but the evidence supporting their effectiveness is limited.

The stone, however, can move to cause obstruction again, but this is unlikely if the stent remains in position. The surgery has to be done under general anesthesia. The procedure used varies based on the location of the stone and your treating urologist. I would have to have a look at the CT (computed tomography) scan images before I can make a plan. I would recommend you to go ahead with the surgery as that gives you the best chance of getting your stone removed. For more information consult a urologist online <|endoftext|>"}

Sun protection factor or SPF blocks damaging UV rays, which are responsible for skin aging, darkening, sunburn, and malignancy. I would advise you to use sunscreens that are a multi-spectrum or broad spectrum, which blocks both UV-A and UV-B rays. Select Sunscreen according to SPF value. SPF number not less than 30 and not more than 50 will serve the purpose. While going to play, you may apply a generous layer of SPF 50, and for the routine purpose, you may use SPF 30. Do  ChatDoctor.  Take care. Have a nice and safe game. For more information consult an internal medicine physician online ","answer_chatgpt":"Hi! I'm sorry to hear that you're experiencing skin damage due to the sun. It's important to understand the concept of SPF (Sun Protection Factor) and choose a suitable sunscreen.\n\nSPF refers to the ability of sunscreen to block UVB (ultraviolet B) rays that cause sunburn. The higher the SPF number, the greater the protection. For example, an SPF 15 sunscreen blocks 93% of UVB rays, while an SPF 30 sunscreen blocks 97% of UVB rays. SPF 50 and above block approximately 98% of UVB rays.\n\nFor daily use, I would recommend using a sunscreen with at least SPF 30, which provides good protection for everyday activities. If you're spending prolonged periods outdoors or participating in sports, opt for a higher SPF such as 50 or 60.\n\nAdditionally, look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays. UVA rays can also cause skin damage and premature aging.\n\nSome popular sunscreen brands with good reviews are Neutrogena, Aveeno, La Roche-Posay, and Coppertone. Choose a sunscreen that suits your skin type and doesn't cause irritation or breakouts.\n\nRemember to apply sunscreen 15-20 minutes before sun exposure and reapply at least every two hours, or more frequently if swimming or sweating. And don't forget to wear a hat and protective clothing when possible to reduce sun exposure. Stay safe in the sun!","answer_chatdoctor":"1) SPF stands for sun protection factor. It is a measure of how long you can stay out in the sun before getting burned without wearing sunscreen. 2) A sunscreen with an SPF of 15 will protect you from the sun's rays for about 15 times longer than if you weren't wearing it. This means that if you would normally burn after 10 minutes in the sun, then you would be protected for 150 minutes (or almost three hours). 3) The higher the number, the better. SPF 60 is much more effective than SPF 30. 4) To get maximum benefit, apply the sunscreen at least 30 minutes before going out into the sun, and reapply every 2-3 hours.","text":"Instruct: Hi doctor,I am in a little trouble.

The black spots on your face and upper back could be due to post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation (PIH) resulting from the popping of pimples.

Sun protection - Applying a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 daily can help prevent further darkening of the skin.\n\n2. Use topical treatments - Over-the-counter creams containing ingredients such as hydroquinone, retinoids, and vitamin C can help fade dark spots over time.

These treatments use alpha-hydroxy acids or similar products to exfoliate the skin and encourage the growth of new, healthy skin cells.\n\n4. Microdermabrasion - This procedure uses a device to exfoliate the top layers of skin, potentially reducing the appearance of dark spots.\n\n5.

Is Levofloxacin a good medicine for this kind of diarrhea?\nOutput: Hello, Welcome to Chat Doctor forum. From what you mentioned, most likely you have acute gastroenteritis. Ciprofloxacin is a very good antibiotic for gastroenteritis. You have to complete a four-day course at least. It may take few days before you see a good result. I suggest: Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. I hope I answered all your questions. <|endoftext|>"}

I have the following suggestions for you which I am sure will specifically help you significantly in the long run. ","answer_chatgpt":"Hello! Thank you for your question. It is very normal to develop fine lines as we age, but it is great that you are being proactive and actively looking for ways to maintain healthy and youthful skin.\n\nThe slight depression you have described could be due to loss of volume in that area or possibly the start of sagging, but it is difficult for me to accurately diagnose without a physical examination. However, facial exercises, massages, and non-invasive techniques like topical anti-aging serums can be helpful in preventing further sagging or reversing minor age-related changes. Retinol-A is a great choice as it is a proven anti-aging ingredient that stimulates collagen production and cell turnover.\n\nWhen it comes to topical vitamin C and E serums, it is true that many of them are not stable and do not penetrate the skin effectively. The most effective vitamin C serums are those that contain L-ascorbic acid and are formulated with additional antioxidants to stabilize the vitamin C. Vitamin E is also a great antioxidant that helps to protect the skin from free radicals.\n\nFacial exercises can be helpful in maintaining muscle tone and preventing further sagging. However, they may not be effective in reversing existing sagging. It is important to remember that any facial exercises should be done with caution as excessive or improper use can cause muscle strain or even worsen sagging.\n\nIn terms of facial treatments, I recommend getting a treatment once a month if possible. For anti-aging, treatments like microdermabrasion, chemical peels, and radiofrequency facials can be helpful. These treatments can help to stimulate collagen production and improve skin texture.\n\nWhen it comes to weight loss, it is important to lose weight gradually and maintain a healthy diet and exercise regimen to prevent excessive weight loss and skin sagging. Additionally, staying hydrated and using a moisturizer regularly can help to keep the skin hydrated and prevent sagging.\n\nOverall, the most effective way to prevent sagging and maintain healthy, youthful skin is to combine a healthy lifestyle with a consistent skin care regimen that includes proven anti-aging ingredients and facial treatments.

{"input":"Hi doctor,One year back, while sitting on a chair in office I felt as if my back got stuck and was unable to move.

I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse. After that I had slight pain in my tail bone while walking and the pain got worse when I sit for five minutes. It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes.I got my ESR and CRP checked. They are normal, but there is a slight increase in lymphocytes and RBC. Now, I have been suffering from this continuous cracking sounds and pain in almost all my joints for more than a month now. I also suffer from severe pain in tail bone area. Also suffers from some sensation loss (not persistent) in left side of my upper left leg, pain in groin area (but not anymore), pain in lower back and upper back. Also a few days back a physiotherapist did some manipulation, which again increased my problem and after that when I wake up in morning both my hands are badly at asleep.

Additionally, modifying your lifestyle habits like regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight can help prevent further complications.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, Thanks for writing to Chat Doctor. I have read your case and can understand your concern. As you mentioned, you have undergone treatment for disc prolapse at L4\/5 and L5\/S1 levels. You have been prescribed bed rest for 9 months. But even after that, you have not recovered completely. This suggests that you may need some additional treatment like physical therapy. You said that you had pain in tailbone area. This is suggestive of nerve compression at sacral level. So, I would advise you to get an MRI scan to rule out any such pathology. In addition, you should also visit an orthopedic surgeon who can examine you and treat you accordingly. Hope this helps.","text":"Instruct: Hi doctor,One year back, while sitting on a chair in office I felt as if my back got stuck and was unable to move. I took two painkillers and managed to sit there for a while, but after two to three hours the pain started radiating to leg. I was diagnosed with moderate disc herniation at L4-L5 and L5-S1. I was advised to take bed rest for three months and felt better after five months. Then I got some manipulation done with my lower back and my condition got worse. After that I had slight pain in my tail bone while walking and the pain got worse when I sit for five minutes. It got radiated to hips, thighs and it was worse when I stood up from a sitting position. Then I left with no option except bed rest for another four months that is a total nine months of bed rest. After that I suddenly started walking two to three hours a day in a stretch and started doing some exercises. After few days of getting my body too much into motion I felt my upper back getting stuck and again was unable to move and the pain radiated to my wrist and hand. Then had bed rest for another 10 days and felt a bit better. But, still in pain and resumed with two to three hours of brisk walking and exercises. I noticed that many joints in my body were making cracking sound while I walk or move my body and they were continuous. They are not going away no matter how much I move that joint, the cracking sound will repeat infinite times whenever I move my body. The cracking sound is mostly from lower and upper back, shoulder, ankle, foot fingers, knees also make that cracking sound and it is painful as well. Cracking sound in knees are felt more when I start walking after being in rest state and frequency of cracking sound reduces after walking for two to three minutes.I got my ESR and CRP checked. They are normal, but there is a slight increase in lymphocytes and RBC. Now, I have been suffering from this continuous cracking sounds and pain in almost all my joints for more than a month now. I also suffer from severe pain in tail bone area. Also suffers from some sensation loss (not persistent) in left side of my upper left leg, pain in groin area (but not anymore), pain in lower back and upper back. Also a few days back a physiotherapist did some manipulation, which again increased my problem and after that when I wake up in morning both my hands are badly at asleep. Doctors say that discs are hydrated and it is rather some other thing which is causing me problems but are unable to diagnose. The amount of rest I have taken and all those manipulations have gone through have only done badly rather than doing any good. I am only 27 years old and unable to do simple tasks like sitting for five minutes. Please help me, what could be the possible reason for all this.I had some back pain three years ago. My lifestyle is also not good. I do not used to any exercise or walk earlier, only sitting on a chair in front of a computer for 10-11 hours. I have also gained weight of 15 kg in 10 months.

However, stress echocardiograms are generally considered less sensitive and specific than nuclear stress tests. \n\nThat being said, stress echocardiograms can still provide valuable information about the heart function and possible signs of CAD. So, it is not entirely true that stress echocardiograms are irrelevant in patients with LBBB. However, nuclear stress testing is generally considered to be the gold standard for CAD screening in patients with LBBB, although it does involve exposure to a small amount of radiation. \n\nYou seem to be taking good care of your health by exercising regularly, and it's great to hear that you have been following up with a cardiologist to monitor your heart health. Your high HDL and low triglycerides are favorable, but your high cholesterol levels could increase your risk of CAD, especially given your family history. \n\nTherefore, I suggest discussing with your doctor the possibility of undergoing a nuclear stress test to evaluate your CAD risk. This would provide you with more accurate results than a stress echocardiogram, and it would enable you to get a clearer picture of your heart's health. \n\nFinally, I would like to emphasize the importance of continuing to follow up with your doctor regularly, especially given your family history of heart disease.

After the age of 40, the risk of fertility issues, miscarriage, and complications during pregnancy increases. Women over the age of 40 also have a higher likelihood of developing gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, placenta previa or abruption, and other medical conditions. \n\nIt is important to schedule a consultation with your obstetrician and discuss your individual health and medical history to determine the best course of action for a successful pregnancy.","answer_chatdoctor":" Thank you for posting your query at Chat Doctor.

The treatment plan for lung cancer patients often depends on the stage of the disease, the specific type of tumor, and other individual factors. Immunotherapy is a good option for patients with PD-L1 positive lung cancer, as it helps to enhance the immune system's ability to fight cancer cells.\n\nHowever, in some cases, chemotherapy may still be recommended as the first-line treatment, particularly if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Docetaxel is a common chemotherapy drug that has been shown to be effective against lung cancer, and Nintedanib is a targeted therapy that can be used in combination to improve results.\n\nIf your wife is not able to tolerate the chemotherapy, immunotherapy may be considered as a treatment option.

You can also adjust the brightness and contrast settings of your computer screen so it's easier on your eyes.\n\n2.

About seven months ago, he had an episode of foreign body pain in the eye which the contact lens could not control. His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now. His ophthalmologist suggested that he discontinue the Azopt drops he had been using in case the preservative was causing some corneal toxicity. His eye pressure without the drops has read at 18 and 20 on separate occasions, but he does have corneal edema which may affect the measurement.

A high ESR may also indicate inflammation. It is good that your urine sample was negative, because that would have indicated a urinary tract infection that could have caused the elevated WBC count. \n\nStress can indeed cause a temporary increase in WBC count, but it usually returns to normal within a few hours or days. It is unlikely that your stress alone would cause such a persistent increase in WBC count.\n\nIf your eye infection is bacterial, then that could be the source of the infection. However, if you have no other symptoms or signs of infection, then it is puzzling as to where the infection could be coming from. \n\nCancer would not typically cause an isolated increase in WBC count without other signs or symptoms. \n\nI would recommend that you follow your doctor's advice and take the antibiotics as prescribed, to treat the possible bacterial infection. You can also discuss with your doctor if any further testing, such as a culture or imaging, would be helpful in determining the cause of the elevated WBC count.\n\nI hope this helps!

","answer_chatgpt":"I am sorry to hear about the patient's condition. Based on the information provided, there are several factors that could be contributing to her breathlessness:\n\n1. Residual pleural effusion: Although pleurodesis can be an effective treatment for pleural effusion, some patients may continue to have residual fluid in the pleural cavity. This can put pressure on the lungs and make it difficult to breathe. It may be helpful to drain the fluid through a thoracentesis or chest tube placement.\n\n2. Bilateral lower lobe consolidation: Consolidation refers to the filling of the air sacs in the lungs with fluid or pus, which can also make it difficult to breathe. This may be due to the patient's underlying cancer or secondary to the interstitial pneumonia or interstitial lung disease.\n\n3. Talc pleurodesis related inflammation: Talc pleurodesis can cause inflammation in the pleural space, which can also contribute to breathlessness. Treatment with steroids (e.g. Methylprednisolone) can help reduce inflammation.\n\n4. Interstitial pneumonia and interstitial lung disease: These conditions can cause ground glass opacification on imaging and can also make it difficult to breathe. Treatment options may include steroids, immunosuppressants, and\/or supportive care.\n\n5. Talc related leg injury: It is unclear how this is related to the patient's breathlessness, but it may be contributing to her overall discomfort and mobility.\n\nIt may be helpful for the patient to undergo additional testing, such as pulmonary function tests or a ventilation-perfusion (V\/Q) scan, to further evaluate her breathlessness. Close monitoring by a multidisciplinary team, including pulmonologists, oncologists, and palliative care specialists, can also help optimize symptom management and supportive care.","answer_chatdoctor":" Hi, thanks for posting your query in Chat Doctor. I can understand your concern regarding his patients condition. As per your history, it appears that the patient is having malignant pleural effusions.

Karyotyping: A blood test to examine chromosomes in the blood to rule out chromosomal abnormalities.\n\n2. Thrombophilia screening: A blood test to check for any genetic predisposition to blood clotting disorders.\n\n3. Hormonal evaluation: A blood test to evaluate hormone levels, including thyroid function tests, prolactin levels, and ovarian reserve markers.\n\n4.

Small perforations of tympanic membrane heal on their own, particularly if traumatic. However, you say that it happened after a flu. You may need to see an otolaryngologist to determine if you have any infection in the middle ear. If otitis media is present you will need a prescription medication to treat that. For now, do not put anything in your ear. While taking a bath, make sure no water gets in. Hope this helps. For more information consult a family physician online <|endoftext|>"}

I understand your problem. You have not mentioned whether your child is male or female. But from the symptoms it seems that he is of about 3 years age. It seems that his mother is over protective and she is afraid that if he will cry or make any sort of sound, then people around will get angry at him. This type of behavior may lead the child to develop some kind of fear psychosis in future which can cause anxiety disorder and depression. He needs proper counseling and counseling sessions for both parents. I hope this helps you. Thank you.","text":"Instruct: Hi doctor,My wife is indifferent to child health issues.

{"input":"Hi doctor, I have been taking Effexor XR 300 mg for depression. It has been working really well. My psychiatrist has now prescribed me Strattera for ADHD. I am about to start 25 mg and work my way upto 80 mg over a few weeks. Strattera and Effexor both seem to inhibit Norepinephrine reuptake. Is it safe to take this combination?

You may know that Effexor XR is effective against depression and Strattera is used to manage ADHD. Sometimes both are prescribed together when you have ADHD along with depression. Your psychiatrist is following a safe approach of starting on a low dose of Strattera (Atomoxetine) and gradually titrating up the dose depending on your response and tolerability.
